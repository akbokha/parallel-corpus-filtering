<seg id="20">In view of this expertise, the institutes are able to draw from a Swiss company and a company of the community one game of watches or movements, which is sufficiently representative and basically comprises no more than 50 clocks or movements.</seg>
<seg id="21">After checking these games according to the standards of legal technical control in Switzerland, the institutes are comparing their results and creating a joint report for the Joint Commission with their conclusions and their eventual suggestions.</seg>

<seg id="23">At least every three years, counting from the entry into force of the agreement, the Mixed Commission proposes a redesign of the list to take account of the recent entries and cancellations.</seg>

<seg id="644">II) Collected information on core material that is subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention may be published on the decision of the Council and with the consent of the directly affected countries or the community, as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="645">A) In the implementation of securing measures pursuant to this Convention, technological development is fully taken into account in the field of security measures, and all efforts are made to ensure optimal cost effectiveness and the application of the principle of an effective safeguarding of the flow of core material that is subject to this Convention assurance measures, by using instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points, as far as the current or future technology makes this possible.</seg>
<seg id="646">B) In order to guarantee optimal cost effectiveness, for example, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial distribution as a means for defining the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the testing procedures on the phases of the fuel cycle, which could be produced in the manufacture, processing, use and storage of nuclear material, from which no further nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons could be manufactured, and the greatest possible restriction of the verification procedures on sonar nuclear material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this convention.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) According to this Convention, the Association of the Organization, in accordance with this Convention, provides information on core material that is subject to securing measures, and the characteristics of the facilities which are relevant for the implementation of the securing measures in relation to this material of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) i) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks in accordance with this Convention.</seg>

<seg id="655">III) If, due to the repeated refusal of the Community, to approve the naming of the Inspectors of the Organization, which shall be hampered by this Convention, the Council shall discuss the refusal, after the General Director of the Organization, in the following as "the Director General," is concerned with the aim of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The community and the affected states undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually perform the tasks which they are facing after their agreement.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i) are as low as possible for the possible harassment and disturbance of the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">(II) The protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information is guaranteed by inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as its inspectors and other civil servants, the duties pursuant to this Convention, the relevant provisions of the Agreement on the Privileges and Liberations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</seg>
<seg id="660">The securing measures after this agreement are concluded regarding core material when the community and the organization establish that the material has been consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity, which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Belang, or has become virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this Convention, the Association notes the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the securing measures under this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="662">The security measures under this agreement will be terminated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state, as foreseen in this Convention, has taken over responsibility for it.</seg>

<seg id="666">B) The organisation and the community make a provision that the securing measures envisaged in this Convention will not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity.</seg>
<seg id="667">In the scheme, as far as possible, how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any event, the preventive measures envisaged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the concerned state or the relevant states and on any passing on such material from this state or these states on the ongoing basis.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their understanding as quickly as possible; it extends only on matters such as temporal and procedural provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not include a endorsement or a secret knowledge of military activity, and does not refer to the successful use of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs of each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the community, the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty, but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization, the organization will reimburse these costs as long as it has been agreed beforehand in advance.</seg>
<seg id="673">In any case, the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage, including insurance or other financial security, may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations, to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the citizens of the States.</seg>

<seg id="676">After examining the relevant information submitted by the Director General, the Council is not able to verify that no core material, which has to be subject to securing measures under this Convention, can be reimbursed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missiles, and if necessary, it may take the other measures envisaged there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council takes into account what mass has been acquired by the applied safety measures, and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security.</seg>
<seg id="678">Upon request of the Organization, the Community or the State, consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are held.</seg>
<seg id="679">The Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be reviewed by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="680">The Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="681">With the exception of disputes, to ascertain the Council after Article 19 or a measure adopted by the Council, disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled on the request of a party to an arbitral tribunal, consisting of five arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="682">The community and the states are naming two arbitrators; the organisation also appoints two arbitrators, and the four arbitrator appointed, choose a fifth that leads the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="683">If the community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitrators within thirty days of the request for an arbitration request, the community or the organization may elect the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="684">The same procedure must be applied if the fifth arbitrator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitrator.</seg>

<seg id="695">Purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure as required in the implementation of the provisions of part I on preventive measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the branching of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants for unknown purposes, as well as the deterrence of such disagreement by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target set in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material not shown for any material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified amounts specified for a particular period of time.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their investigations, the Organization makes full use of the Community's security system after Article 3.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the core material community based on this agreement rests on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their security measures, the Community of de processes and measures will make use of the following methods and, as far as it is necessary, foresee how they are defined in the supplementary agreements and are practical:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measurement system to determine the quantities of obtained, produced, lost, lost, or otherwise removed nuclear material and stock quantities;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) procedures for determination, testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and receiver;</seg>
<seg id="705">(e) procedures for the evaluation of accumulations of non-measured stocks and non-measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol - and reporting system which indicates the core material inventory and changes in the material balance zone for each sheet of material and the changes of this stock, including the input and output of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">G) provisions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Method to reimburse reports to the organization according to articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures under this Agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material that has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c) is introduced into the states, so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) relies on core material, which is suitable for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The securing measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. however, if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled, the association is temporarily not possible or desirable to recover from residues, the organization and the community shall consult each other on the application of appropriate safety measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguards provided in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">On request of the Community, the Organization exempts the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material, if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material used in non-nuclear activities according to Article 13 if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of plutonium-238 which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">Upon request of the Community, the organization frees core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention, of these safeguards unless the entire material quantity delivered by this Article in states is at no longer at any point</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram special material that can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) Uran with an enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above is calculated by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) Uran with an enrichment which lies below 0.2 (20%) and above the natural uranium is calculated by the multiplication of its weight with the five-fold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium enrichment with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should the core material be delivered together with core material that is subject to the securing measures under this agreement, be processed or stored, precautions are made for the re-use of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community is meeting with the Organization of Supplementary Abmachinations, which is necessary for the successful and effective grooming of the duties of the organization according to the Convention, in detail how to apply the procedures set out in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplemental agreements may be extended or altered without amendment of this Convention in agreement between the organization and the Community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplemental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention into force. the Organization, the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">Based on the initial report outlined in Article 62, the organization presents a summarized inventory of the total core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention, regardless of its origins, and continues to carry out this inventory because of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">In weighing up GRÜNDE - a) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hampered by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that all the contributions paid by the Member States are bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the links to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table from which it is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization aligns a special account under the name "Special Trade Account," which the Member States contributed in accordance with this agreement to the special transaction account; this account is managed and used by the organisation as administrator, only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or intrinsic notes of the member state, which, upon request, to pay in the currency of the relevant state to the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited with the organization's deposit in that country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments, i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to January 1, 1979, or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the caretaker, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budgetary plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments to the above-mentioned dates on request.</seg>
<seg id="740">The administrator takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or school notes according to the usual procedures of the organization in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expectable development program or project (including a sectoral plan) which is considered, approved, and administrated by the organisation funded by the organisation, regardless of whether it is the institution funded by the organisation, which is to be considered in the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the non-cash account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or of the Organization, which has been approved by the Bank's directors or the organisation within the framework of a loan or loan for a program or project.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally valid for the institution loans granted by the organization; thus, in the case of ten years of free time, they are repayable in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this watch must be paid directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Receipts from each transaction loan can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a member state; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a transaction loan, in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of loan guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="752">The capital repayments of special loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in this manner in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator shall instruct the EEC to complete all the special loans provided by the directors in preparation and through the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special loans, the administrator teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special loans and the expenses incurred for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the financial account with a statement of the external auditor of the organization at this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">Upon full payment of the special loans, the caretaker of the EEC transmits a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions to the cash account, the amounts paid to the account, the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker make an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account from time to time, the progress of programs or projects financed by special transactions and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organisation may, if necessary, have not entered into force, the agreement and all resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital of all the special loans taken by the recipients is refunded in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and transferred to Member States, this agreement and all obligations arising therefrom are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are noting the conclusion of the proceedings to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.</seg>
<seg id="764">The General Secretariat will forward these notifications together with a notification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notifications in the organization.</seg>
