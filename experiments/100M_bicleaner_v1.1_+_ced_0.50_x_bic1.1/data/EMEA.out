this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B. vor@@ tex thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal tuning .
abili@@ fy is used to treat severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems if oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melt tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are also broken down as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ rans@@ mitter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment were examined .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution for intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received am@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if administered in addition to an existing treatment .
am@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar effective as lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled shr@@ ink@@ age ) , tre@@ mor ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and related man@@ ic episodes to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals daily .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also for treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ a@@ emia ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zation , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ aboli@@ zation .
considering the common gift of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weighed for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors the dose of am@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day did not show any significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ zzo ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ysts ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and because of the concerns produced in the reproduction studies of the animal , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - A controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was reduced overall ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in O@@ lan@@ z@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosage , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C rac@@ co@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the Put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who taught a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ sum@@ - depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ ses was achieved for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ t@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superior efficacy in comparison with placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase for man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ sation period prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metaboli@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did schiz@@ ophren@@ ic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ related effects .
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ did potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al in@@ fusion carcin@@ omas / carcin@@ omas at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ all of apes and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold in the mid @-@ range Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was reported in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor .
in an O@@ lan@@ t@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superior efficacy in comparison with placebo .
the relationship between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) was found in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with healthy volunteers .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used for quick control of agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and begin using oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle with circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melt tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ a@@ emia ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS include high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating , and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or with risk factors for diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and bi@@ polar disorder patients due to combination bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were used as one @-@ off intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and who at the same time received Lor@@ z@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , the common application with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metaboli@@ zation can result in increased plasma concentrations of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors the dose of am@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) in clinical trials .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater enh@@ ancements of agi@@ lity / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the agi@@ lity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ z@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agi@@ lity , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents who taught a response to study medication in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ ses was significantly reduced , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ t@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation period , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C was 90 % bigger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , after giving the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were in@@ tra @-@ muscular in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
safety @-@ related concerns of mat@@ ern@@ ally exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg were observed in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application .
based on the conventional studies using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ v@@ entri@@ cular potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metaboli@@ tes of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer attended , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs .
considering the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time until disease worsen@@ ing and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were referring to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ ots in the blood before or before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and that in contrast to other pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ based therapy is not shown ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Type 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been conducted and there are currently no adequate data on recommen@@ ding dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formul@@ as of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in patients no new abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly lab@@ elled car@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac incident in the indicated patient population is not un@@ common , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if the patient dies after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting , and diar@@ rhea , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic drugs and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , besides the treatment of the mother with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
before treatment , male patients should be advised to receive a sperm con@@ serving because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the ability to transport and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 , the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally , increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gy , blo@@ ating , tongue burn , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , sore throat , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness , very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is an optim@@ ising mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the con@@ tainment of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ary protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two un@@ signed un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised common condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % due to metastatic and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line treatment are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Type 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for lowering on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the drug exposure level ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After using Abra@@ x@@ ane with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel .
the clearing of pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent @-@ based pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and to two smaller metaboli@@ tes ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the average for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the un@@ modified active ingredient was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proof at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ li@@ ta@@ xel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be respected when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile injection , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the break @-@ through bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the break @-@ through bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done .

member states must ensure that the holder of the permit for the placing on the market is provided with the following information and materials in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies prior to the market launch :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , provided cool@@ boxes for transport by patients .
this means that the stre@@ amed of a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood tests that may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if an individual blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ sc@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to have an own blood don@@ or , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and for patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per deci@@ liter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene by injection into a V@@ ene as part of a primary study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o to a V@@ ene for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Lang@@ stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed bot@@ tom@@ ed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from a ren@@ al disease caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Lang@@ stre@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the starting value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the com@@ mon@@ est side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion .
se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union legislation , Ab@@ se@@ amed showed that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the safety of the drug for the medical staff of all member states , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction in trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger operational interventions requiring large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall health burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is 25 % reduced .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose is 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall health burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in light of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ inv@@ ari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the column number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the column number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the column number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l has increased , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ aries is required , sever@@ ed stre@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg of body weight should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the stre@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately after it .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic salt solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ an@@ emia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) with some ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin should not receive se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following morning , accompanying or underlying disease in patients who are unable to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the rec@@ ti@@ cul@@ ation value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ate intoxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the item value is decreased ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason for an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and a study of bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous U@@ V@@ ital applications in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / d@@ l. ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ine when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ dated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of an underlying cardiovascular disease .
furthermore , it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or decrease the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted from 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro examinations of tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
more than th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , ather@@ os@@ cl@@ ero@@ sis , ret@@ ar@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically optimized epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ sed and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate percentage are identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be demonstrated with the aid of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after IV injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are designated 24 hours after the first administration or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ que fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately the 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced financial loss of body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .

134 In animal studies with approximately the 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced financial loss of body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of 3 days outside the fridge and not exceeding 25 ° C .
141 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the procedure ( day 0 ) .
143 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration , recommended in Section 4.2 , should not be exceeded .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .

during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ stores in further treatment .
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
iron deficiency , red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before starting treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , it will break down your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
if the potassium levels are higher or rising , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until potassium levels are back to normal levels .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a given value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ s@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ sc@@ ency dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lis@@ m ) .
if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells and may , under certain circumstances , have a negative effect on the tumor .
if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is available to you before treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your levels of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / apply , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood type ( an@@ emia ) responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary in order to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may prescri@@ be regular blood tests if necessary in order to verify the outcome of the treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a given value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor stops this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sy@@ ringe Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ in@@ ching o@@ ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Parti@@ cular precau@@ tion in the application of se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can - irrespective of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - come to a blood c@@ rop@@ ath formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ post th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your starting weight is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or if you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones brit@@ tle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as falling ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache during the three days after the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was investigated .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies with a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood again or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( excluding oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those of placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures decreased by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most adverse events of Ac@@ la@@ sta appear within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ol@@ ed@@ o@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion area and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( bone tissue death ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications how the drug is to be used , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited an approval for Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s marketing activities throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , as required twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) are not recommended for patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min because limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and juven@@ iles Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data for safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available to patients who require dental interventions , whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ o@@ ei@@ c acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which were associated with ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and reduced kidney function in oste@@ opor@@ osis were more than three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal threshold ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient levels of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administ@@ ering Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been extensively studied , mainly in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with an Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an equ@@ alisation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown as ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the fem@@ oral neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ras frac@@ tures lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures at 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density in the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ ur by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge were taken .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the retention of tra@@ be@@ cular bone structure compared to placebo .
bone serum markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C telep@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total tot@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points of time compared to placebo treatment .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , an annual dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the once @-@ weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate relative to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , predominantly light to moderate Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( middle serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 @-@ fold increase of age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proved in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( responded to therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , was maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ o@@ ei@@ c acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimin@@ atory phase with a terminal eli@@ oration period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the fast resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because it is not metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome acid in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ é@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and excessive kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ous acid .
as there is only limited data for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal single @-@ dose intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C exceed the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , equivalent ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent findings with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages starting from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels .

risk Management Plan The holder of approval for the placing on the market comm@@ its to carry out the studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance carried out in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all subsequent approved versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which might affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone structure weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta appears to norm@@ alize bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forcing the bone again .
if you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / apply , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs from which it is known that they damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are worried that you will have enough liquid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta appears for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood during the time after the in@@ fusion is not too low .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before finishing treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta Falls , consider the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions are less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is not clear if Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms while you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium levels in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , net@@ tle rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture surgery , it is recommended to undertake the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients need to be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition , A@@ compli@@ a is applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above respectively , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
in addition , four studies have been carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which , in comparison to a placebo , levels of compli@@ a have been used as a suppor@@ tive tool for the setting of smoking .
studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of compli@@ a in this field was difficult to estimate .
what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? it The most common side effects of compli@@ a that have been observed during the studies ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can boost the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advised with concur@@ rent use of drugs such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole or is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ night avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight it@@ te

it is additionally recommended for diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 on the basis of the lack of data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
ri@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case exceed the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who do not have any recognis@@ able risks in addition to obesity , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other recep@@ tive individuals ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

we examined obes@@ e patients and patients with an obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic disorders .
it was statisti@@ cally significant that the corresponding placebo rate was statisti@@ cally significant ( for adverse events ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) .
often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only minor symptoms were observed in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of individuals were given one @-@ off charges of up to 300 mg .
in conclusion , patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and a simultaneous hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
weight reduction after one year amounted to 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline value versus 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference - 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

in a second study in patients with an obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the average weight change between the 20 mg and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and explained about 50 % by weight reduction .

patients with black skin color can have an up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C compared to other ethnic populations .
n popular mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the following adverse events that were not observed in clinical trials , which were observed in animals after exposure to human therapy , were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions appears to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturbances .
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated by the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposition with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be applied to patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ one treatment , except for hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia patients ( low blood sugar ) , and the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes more readily available .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effects of the additional administration of acet@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels reduced by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ i@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in cases where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased , the liver enzyme measurements must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction like e.g. un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on should be guided by clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been performed .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ ha@@ ges ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) was observed under therapy with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
following the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , about an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone does not have relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from the available data ) .
these lead to temporary alter@@ ation of the lens and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ege on three times the upper limit of the standard area were equally frequent as placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ resin .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on respectively .
since the market introduction has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , however , more often when Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication was performed .
in the Pro@@ Active study that had been running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on seems to have an effect on the activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ lin@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on at 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ lin@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimi@@ zing with insulin was random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin only ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone was observed .
in clinical studies more than a year , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small study of 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as margin@@ ally , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or lic@@ enti@@ grade , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on , while lower values were observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ l@@ ci@@ d .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on did not only reduce the gro@@ in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to pre @-@ existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone in humans the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ exclusion period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ zone amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and its metaboli@@ tes are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy oc@@ cured in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduces the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in a animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole @-@ ions resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic tumors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on one side and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in a further study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied , each with Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on or G@@ lic@@ lin@@ zi@@ d .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ratio was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on reduced not only the gro@@ wers tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation over the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary re@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis and vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gli@@ ta@@ z@@ on .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane introduced a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to another insulin insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed against the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dose is required .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after switching from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
when travelling through several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor therefore needs to take into account possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ esis therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ ct@@ ose in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ er@@ als Neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 Inten@@ si@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in the blood sugar setting can , however , be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin and skin tissue diseases - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At injection point , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur if failed to change the inser@@ tion points within the injection area .
during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma may occur at the injection site ) .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ onic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / loss of consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , gradually develop : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , biscuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Sever@@ al hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ trac@@ amer@@ al or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration amounts to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metaboli@@ tes formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push@@ button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check the number on the cap right next to the dosing mark • Qu@@ ote the highest number you can see on the push@@ button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • In case you have a wrong dose , turn the cap simply forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
otherwise , insulin will leak from the injection needle and the set dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set up a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps :
then remove the cap and put it back in such a way that the 0 of the dosing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push@@ button only during the injection . • Ke@@ ep the push button completely down after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
if not , turn the cap until the push button is completely pushed down and then proceed as described before using • You can hear a cli@@ ck@@ ling noise when pressing the press button .
it may not be accurate • You can not set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

this can happen : • if you are inj@@ ecting too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal - if you are more than physically demanding
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let chassis when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the cover cap . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ er • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Take the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ g the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • knock a couple of times with the finger easily against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , these will gather up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to keep up the injection needle , rotate the cartridge by one click towards the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle further upwards , press the push@@ button inside ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin must escape from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap back in such a way that the digit is 0 opposite the fe@@ e@@ ders ( figure D ) • Check if the push button is completely pushed down .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pushed out of the injection needle • The scale on the connecting cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push@@ button ( push@@ button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 . note the highest number you can see on the push@@ button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have a wrong dose , turn the cap simply forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you will feel a resistance . then take the cap off and put it back in such a way that the 0 of the dosing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the push button completely down after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may not be accurate • You can not set up a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you cannot use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ o@@ ic is applied in patients who already show signs of de@@ formation of crystals , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or arthritis ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of ur@@ at@@ yp@@ al deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still above 6 mg per deci@@ liter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic sei@@ zur@@ es may still occur , which is why it is recommended that patients continue to use further medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ovi@@ cs .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , where 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ovi@@ tic dos@@ ages ( 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( 80 and 120 mg once a day ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took an average of 80 mg dose of Aden@@ ur@@ ic and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once a day , at the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ ate deposits ( including a compound known or currently present in the patient &apos;s history and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum levels of serum levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , an increase in dose can be taken into account at the AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents as there is no experience in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient population is not recommended .
transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ containing medicines , acute rheum@@ atism may occur during the beginning of the treatment , because the lowering of the serum resin cone may first mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the course of the follow ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was not conducted any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the level of the@@ ophy@@ ll ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without any dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not affect the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ et in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patients years ) and in long @-@ term long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patients years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic and / or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the related events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 trials ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :

active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and occurs as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro hibition that lies under the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month specific serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the commonly used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum in@@ in@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum in@@ in@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dysfunction The A@@ PE@@ X trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum levels in patients regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study conducted in two years showed that the continued reduction in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a de@@ hydr@@ ation ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a de@@ hydr@@ ation ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gir@@ th , which resulted in 54 % of the patients complete disappearance of the top no@@ des up to 24 months .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ loc@@ ali@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are dose @-@ proportional .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2,@@ 8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes were observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at plasma protein binding is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver disease , these oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes were formed mainly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after consuming an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ Glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active agent ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as an unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ Glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metaboli@@ tes and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metaboli@@ tes ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to normal kidney function .
in the group with normal kidney function , the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 times 7,5 μ Ã -@@ ml in the group with a normal kidney function in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver Rest@@ ri@@ ction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ d@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metaboli@@ tes did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metaboli@@ tes after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed treated group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 3 @-@ fold the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure did not show ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with the last three month specific serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the open extension study conducted in two years showed that the continued reduction in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients required 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a de@@ hydr@@ ation ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a de@@ hydr@@ ation ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become brit@@ tle ) in women after menop@@ ause in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient should not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the Company submitted data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE exactly matches the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive tract such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , broken abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic dissolution .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used for es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. a permit for transferring AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the onset of the day . • Pati@@ ents should not crush the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , can only be administered with special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al lines , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of oste@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take on symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while no increased risk was observed in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are from cancer patients , but also reported about oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , measures of the serum cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ come of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ mes to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ia can lead to increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate studies once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) were demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi@@ center study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the Phase III studies , the middle intake of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate increased 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % on the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate a reduction of 48 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the incidence of at least a new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg following ni@@ ghtly fast and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
oste@@ opor@@ osis was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average by 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic cle@@ arances did not exceed 200 ml / min .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not secre@@ ted by the kidneys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5,@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an period until the maximum serum concentration reached ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , the biot@@ rans@@ formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ cycl@@ ed to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
elimination of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 to healthy volunteers the average elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2,4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the amount of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones can be expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see Section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ ant is given to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ t by the immune system .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has submitted the results of previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of adv@@ ant with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ up@@ take of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined how adv@@ ant is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

for patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ enti@@ a may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful if other ( particularly some herbal ) medicines are taken concur@@ r@@ ently with adv@@ ant , since the adv@@ ant dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dose ; changes to the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close control of a doctor experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of adv@@ ant should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level measurements ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under adv@@ ant to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ cleared substance , an adap@@ tion of the adv@@ ant can take several days to reach the Ste@@ ady State .
if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application For supp@@ ressing the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therapy should begin at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therapy should begin at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a recipient of two daily doses of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules must be converted to a once daily intake of adv@@ ant , so this conversion has to take place at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the recommended oral and liver transplan@@ t .
heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to adv@@ ant , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day can be taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience in lung , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients , had an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in patients with reduced liver function for patients with reduced liver function may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ox@@ in , and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mus during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ level levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after modi@@ fying pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ ant , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually within 5 - 20 ng / ml in the first time after liver transplantation - and heart transplan@@ t patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ dition@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close control of a doctor experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation of adv@@ ant .
for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and pedi@@ gre@@ es in childhood , no clinical data are available for the ret@@ ar@@ aging formulation of adv@@ ant .
the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ ant can be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is necessary , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was considered to be a cardi@@ omy@@ opathy referred to as a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur also in adv@@ ant .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothes or using a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PR@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as the Macro@@ dus antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , which can affect metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thereby increase hormonal exposure , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially concerning its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyper@@ kal@@ emia ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

cases of associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ ant .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumors in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the compound in the cell inside .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells , dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group patients ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oliti@@ s obli@@ ter@@ ans@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi@@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ ts , which were random@@ ized using Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the targeted levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , will be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs over the bile .
in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mus during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic inspections during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ated formulation of adv@@ ant .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid pollution and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ a is used for the treatment and prevention of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart disorder due to the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ant is applied to treat ble@@ ed@@ ings or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ a is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical interventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of adv@@ ata in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ata ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ata may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II @-@ defect , on location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified amount of plasma ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. should be given by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to verify an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) versus Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directional Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , although the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ ghter ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who performed all previously untreated patients with a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ E@@ GA occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values at the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exercise days showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients inhibit@@ ors versus Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the active factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal to or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has maintained the benefit @-@ risk assessment further as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s safety profile , which makes a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for permission to use adv@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus can not trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumours and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene existing in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he had asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on examining the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the Inj@@ ection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ fer@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancements can be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly releases over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nose path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents under 12 years of age , the recommended dose of a@@ verages is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy was the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms besides con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under a@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth drought , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
a@@ ero may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bot@@ t@@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular diseases including hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( caused by brain bleeding ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic strokes .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but must be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing it , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , di@@ meth@@ ot@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tions which are per@@ oral or nas@@ al than swa@@ ying rhin@@ ologi@@ cs ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or strengthening of headache ) must be dis@@ continued .
patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , bladder so@@ ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a@@ ero a@@ ze must be disposed of at least 48 hours before the completion of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and those treated with placebo , irrespective of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines can not be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n did not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the use of a@@ ero during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impairment of the traffic fat@@ ness or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ies .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , per@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ coron@@ ary pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin consol@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of P @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ ero tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of a@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall results of the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
in terms of sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences .
as part of a single dose study of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration of plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were badly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine has been bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance that can un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets reduce symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves rash and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous cir@@ rho@@ sis were also very rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of melt tablets ( tablets dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 m@@ l. of sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rup@@ ed , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after 6 weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were considered , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
ast@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms cease and resume after re@@ occurring .
in the case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases , which may lead to impairment of the traffic fat@@ ness or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 juven@@ ile patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ect@@ ant &apos;s adhesi@@ on molecules on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45@@ mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the total core of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology not@@ withstanding the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
since hist@@ am@@ inf@@ om@@ ination is an caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also improves symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering of size and number of qu@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 in vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies of safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

ast@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by an infection in children under 2 years ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data available to support an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
besides the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ atic in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group as in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged 1 to 11 who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received daily des@@ lor@@ dosis duration of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in an individual daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor therapy in adults and adolescents in clinical studies .
in clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the concur@@ rent intake of alcohol did not increase the intake of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the total core of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets reduce effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and lowering of size and number of qu@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active compound concentrations according to once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 Recommen@@ ded dosage studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that drug interactions can not be excluded completely with other medicines .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ i@@ ded bottles with child resistant poly@@ propylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate is taken for taking into account without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 m@@ g. of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose @-@ trials , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the total core of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets daily put into the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melt tablet removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melt tablets for the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly vary significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate to be used - formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
at a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly metaboli@@ sing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was , however , not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for inclusion , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children aged 6 to 11 years .
food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x of A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate , while food T@@ max of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n extends from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours .

in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ lis@@ ate for inclusion , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the total analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical trials for the melt tablet revealed that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irritation in clinical use .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ ol@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to that of the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months the most common side effects reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of a lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for inclusion had no side effects observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown by the total core of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the load caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than for Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since the A@@ eri@@ us Solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
different single dose study showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n could be compared to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
by administ@@ ering the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspection from some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination was not investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be classified if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with 100 mg of k@@ night avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines twice a day .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gener@@ ase , which was strengthened with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml compared to placebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the increased viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment was just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger residual of the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued to receive their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ irrit@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee found that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors was not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited an approval for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be administered together with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.5 ) for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ night avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function problems , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ ger@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generic capsules should usually be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcomes .
in case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these drugs at the same time , ast@@ er@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ l content of the A@@ ger@@ ase solution for inclusion , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled for a duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the onset of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us .
many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy drugs which are associated with the development of diabetes mel@@ lit@@ us or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors associated with a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , which lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also show sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given along with medicines whose active agents are metaboli@@ sed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance evolution .
in trying to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ night avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already adop@@ ts St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ atal virus and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x being reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , confir@@ ming the efficacy and safety of this regi@@ men .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the ci@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to monitor closely , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of A@@ gener@@ os@@ in in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ an component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cruci@@ ble .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ night avi@@ r on del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concur@@ rent administration .
simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of ket@@ o@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can cause resor@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , Nic@@ cardi@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
concur@@ rent intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metaboli@@ te is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase plasma levels while administ@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma sampling of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ sing the mirror is recommended since plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while adding am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while careful use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is required .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , particularly if low doses of k@@ night avi@@ r are also administered .
due to the very low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while adding A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in lac@@ tation of lac@@ tation , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of lac@@ tation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , comp@@ acted early and rarely resulted in the termination of treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ J@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ eas@@ ep@@ ics did not receive pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( sti@@ cking ) .
in 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull &apos;s ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
rash usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ule nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception was the increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must be observed on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the process of viral gene and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ sis pre @-@ stages with the result of an un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - these mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients receiving 1,@@ 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ night avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic testing systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / k@@ night avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mutation V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / S , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic samples produces a certain cross resistance against k@@ night avi@@ r , sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all four Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ atal virus failed ( one of which demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which adults treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI , and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to time @-@ adjusted average variation of the bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ subli@@ minal threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ ger@@ ase was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x lowered by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after met@@ ering ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( c@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
this is why medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or introduce a substrate from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these schem@@ ata lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneously administ@@ ering Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas comp@@ lied with dos@@ ages containing the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , gave little indication of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ations tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily routine by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , either during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
however , with a systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which point to delayed development , were observed .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ night avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out with care in patients with weak or slight liver function problems , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled for a duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance evolution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ MA@@ x being reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the ci@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to monitor closely , since the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be undertaken , as an accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ night avi@@ r on del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available .

in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in combination with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ mine of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of lac@@ tation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must be observed on signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of PI pre @-@ treated children .

in long @-@ term studies for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred with dos@@ ages containing the 2,@@ 0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after two daily doses of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ ger@@ ase &apos;s solution for intake and low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ ger@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ ger@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for taking in infants and children under the age of 4 , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous appointments can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ ger@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .

this can include fat loss on legs , arms and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast enlargement and fat tumors in the neck ( &quot; bull &quot; ) .
other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polye@@ thylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , to@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( T@@ P@@ GS ) , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial chew@@ ing gum , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , it can be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin@@ ly applied to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin for long ( about eight hours ) before being washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo had to be carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete recovery of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has been continued until all visible asc@@ ents have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ odic area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination lasts 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is left out , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in a thin layer and insert into the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
these patients should consider weighing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should consider weighing between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ eman@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case were observed with a pattern of circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been available for applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ aneous appli@@ qu@@ és in the genital and peri@@ odic area .
limited data may indicate an increased rate of up@@ war@@ dness reductions in HIV positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has shown lower efficacy in this patient population in relation to the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super@@ fic@@ ated bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application for pre @-@ treated tumors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less likel@@ ihood of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip field .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the efficacy of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not achiev@@ able after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly shared and likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported at 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below .
the most common adverse event , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , was a reaction of the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) in these studies .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs , according to the protocol , shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream often lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / leaf / sli@@ pping ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs , according to the protocol , shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine spread often resulted in severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sc@@ oring and sc@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ time oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral dos@@ ages of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony norm@@ alized after oral or IV hydr@@ ation .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior regarding a complete healing of the readiness for an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
60 % of patients who treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od completely healed the patients ; this was in 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tumors were hist@@ ological confirmed single primary super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at three times weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external ti@@ lt war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ normal cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ normal cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application carried out for four months did not reveal any similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during malign@@ ant administration of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the point of use .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or hospital with re@@ vit@@ ation equipment , and patients may need medicines to prevent an allergic reaction prior to administration .

the study was focused mainly on the safety of the drug , but it has also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its efficacy in reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion area .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of the lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been established , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all of the patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in resum@@ ing treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 . ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular incorpor@@ ation of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ born babies who have been exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase @-@ 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequency ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe trial and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ a@@ version occurred within 3 months of the start of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 most often came to a serum version within one month ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) 13 / 45 patients were not able to detect antibodies using radio@@ immuno@@ hist@@ ories ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ a@@ version .
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres .
four patients ( three in phase 3 and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enz@@ ym@@ atic therapy lies in a recovery of enzyme activity which is sufficient for hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire range of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had an accelerated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to work with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as emerged from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volume increased further in proportion to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atomic loss before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ level was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant up to the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was considered clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of movement of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change was observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe forms of circulation and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed according to the Z @-@ score for this age group . younger patients with the severe form of circulation ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe forms of circulation , only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase 4 study , research on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing schemes was performed on G@@ AG levels in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except those listed under 6,@@ 6 .

this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ aves certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicine , including non @-@ prescription medicines .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer medicines ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies are used as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vomiting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a primary study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells had longer survival times in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta compared to the same medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the penetration bottle and dil@@ uted with 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the conclusion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed Gift as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ q , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the na@@ di@@ rs of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of predic@@ tive treatment cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be termin@@ ated if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- or so @-@ on at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 , or above , there is an increased side effect risk in comparison to patients aged 65 .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , exceeding the dose adap@@ tions recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to 3.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row suppression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number again has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the level 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 took place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ q must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for whom treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is fores@@ een , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the ergometer is to be weighed prior to the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible injury of the reproductive ability by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the retention of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds are available with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is obligatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ servi@@ ence .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and were random@@ ized with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and in 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received random@@ ized cr@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
frequency indications : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on available data of spontaneous reports ) .
* * * referring to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , taste distur@@ b@@ ance and hair loss should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was determined concerning the inclusion of all events in which the report consul@@ ted a correlation with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 26@@ 5 patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as mon@@ otherapy with the benefits of fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 27@@ 6 patients who had random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as mon@@ otherapy .
* * referring to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , hair loss should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2 .
for this table a threshold of 5 % was determined concerning the recording of all events in which the report consul@@ ted a correlation with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for this table .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , comprised su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity degree 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the pool@@ ed results of three single patients ( n = 16@@ 4 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population because the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could possibly be related to study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSCLC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .
* * * referring to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) for any toxic@@ ity degree . * * * moved to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) to report flavour disorder and hair loss only as Grade 1 or 2 .
for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified for the recording of all events in which the report was given a correlation with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( frequently ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized cr@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed were :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular proliferation , and transi@@ ent isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported occasionally in hospital studies of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
from clinical studies , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
in clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs were reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ ating pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients were reported before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important and acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ ase ( TS ) , di@@ hydro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind , Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ months prolonged survival compared to those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin only .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms of treatment resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy achieved medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival occurred in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 vs. 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) prior treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ abine in C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sub@@ standard limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who are allergic to All@@ i and do not lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se certain fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats fed to food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took all@@ i 60 m@@ g. after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study of allergy in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of allergy ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ ec@@ es , fa@@ ec@@ es , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily stool , ec@@ al secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited company a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction in adults with excess weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ tical , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed to minimal absorption , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not need to adapt the dosage .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Pre@@ vent time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional precau@@ tionary measures to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , it should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are primarily gastro@@ intestinal and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of known adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight people without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lip @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect activ@@ ates in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ er@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day to block the absorption of approximately 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ tical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( starting value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( starting value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( starting value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average amend@@ ment was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metaboli@@ tes , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ on@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after split@@ ting of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients showing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data will not be able to detect particular danger for humans .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time you may have not consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Start some days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them over time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ cones , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swallow it . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talks to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day .
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
take a look at the information below that indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects .
34 This reduced cal@@ oric intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you exercise every day only little or no more , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. through 3 km of walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .

alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ st@@ ination or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required in the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or that tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied against tumours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and aut@@ op@@ sy ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 750 m@@ c@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given on day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate , and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G impact of low @-@ dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after IV dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that of a single intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time consumption of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metaboli@@ tes , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ changeable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients , the total body unit was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination of the termin@@ ations and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications suggest@@ ing that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and increase the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid gland , pit@@ u@@ it@@ ary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

June 2006 , the CH@@ MP Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report recommen@@ ding the use of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ectable medication for the placing of the approval for the placing of the medicine intended for the treatment of hepatitis C .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should be similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a microsc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine am@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast , in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the Reference Pharmac@@ eutical in 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set up ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trials .
after treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease returned to more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine dis@@ sol@@ ves an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected dor@@ mers ( cra@@ cking or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ ine @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go does not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used for patients from the age of nine months , but for patients under 18 years of age , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) , thereby inhibit@@ ing the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection oc@@ cured at the end of the treatment .
139 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were considered by skin patients , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irritation to the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed against the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mary , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by applying ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials for secondary wounds the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo cannot be expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on the sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , doses adjustments are not required if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on effects on birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether the breast@@ feeding should continue / termin@@ ate or continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
function Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ ome P @-@ binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ ing pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ ome sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of retin@@ in@@ ulin might seem question@@ able at at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ in@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on pe@@ ened skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % retin@@ in@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid disorders .
in @-@ vitro analysis of gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility with oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ inn@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is being used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , potentially preventing hepatitis B after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ ization process , ensuring that the vaccine can be managed from two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defence ) , as it can resist a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin in 1996 , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect them against the same diseases , but Twin@@ xes and Twin@@ xes are given as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ matrix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ et adults were also used as evidence for using Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for Pri@@ m@@ mun@@ ci@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses of vaccine , taking the first dose at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mono@@ ov@@ ary vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ Hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mono@@ ov@@ ary vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured if immun@@ ological individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need to have a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all vacc@@ ines , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , containing 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of further doses of vaccine can be necessary .
these inj@@ ections should be avoided as an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome .
however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ely in thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots as it can result in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza @-@ rub@@ bing vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary to assume that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ ery and preserv@@ atives @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the patients who had received Ambi@@ rix had reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the incidence of mat@@ ing was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of pronounced pain and mat@@ ch@@ iness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses that have been achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ olds after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ an A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds one could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year at the same time with the onset of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influenza @-@ rub@@ bing @-@ rub@@ bing vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults pointed to the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after resor@@ ting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and drinks , but can also be transferred by other means , such as swimming in water contaminated by wastewater .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect from infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses of vaccine ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of the vaccine ) , a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) for you / your child .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend to you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and may give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes ambient matrix is spra@@ yed in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child are taking more medications / taking ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have received / your child was vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received / or that is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , but it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 twisted cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the spot or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 le@@ aped doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Re@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that were reported for days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ ked doses ) are :
these include locally limited or extended ki@@ cks that can be it@@ chy or can be con@@ ve@@ x , swelling of the eyes and face , sc@@ ary breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and loss of consciousness .
flu @-@ like symptoms , including shi@@ vers , muscular and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , gri@@ ev@@ ances such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mobility of some parts of the body , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions
fain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels discomfort or feeling of disease , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and abdominal pain are alterations in the liver function , lymp@@ h no@@ des swelling , increased tendency to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by waste of the amount of blood .
23 inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child is significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was launched only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient &apos;s exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ rap@@ es@@ - split by several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered by a gastro@@ enter@@ ial ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ vor@@ ing or ta@@ ch@@ iness , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels .
ammon@@ ia was permitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval it was only limited information about this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a lat@@ in@@ ic form ( incomplete enzyme that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein up@@ take of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine at a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal propag@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it was not possible to determine whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred at 56 % of the patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate can , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which in intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore also suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram of assimil@@ ated sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease himself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga in the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first treatment of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ote form of the or@@ ni@@ nozzle tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metaboli@@ tes in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metaboli@@ tes was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ kl@@ ine disrup@@ tions or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis that were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma cruci@@ ble were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate did not have a toxic effect in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who do not yet swallow pill or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ enter@@ ial or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born babies , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ in@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contain 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before birth , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metaboli@@ te of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate can , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
bi@@ omet@@ rically , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of studies on the secre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that for each gram of assimil@@ ated sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ule form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after the intake .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
for this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon weighs 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to get the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with any dose or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or a year in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ ep@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart disease .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the marketing of angi@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous rejection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs .
immediately prior to the procedure , a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initi@@ al intraven@@ ous stu@@ n of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single case of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din treated against AC@@ S or not ) , lower in@@ fusion rates of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT score is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is re @-@ examined 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was approved for authorisation , the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of lower molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against her@@ bac@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible vascular endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of arter@@ ial hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in the case of PCI patients under bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can , in principle , occur everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after dis@@ continuation of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din once again reaches the level existing before treatment .
based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregate inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly .
the animal experiments are insufficient regarding the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ ov@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i for severe bleeding such as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ muscular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reducing the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level , re@@ operation due to bleeding , using blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding disturbances that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI examination .
both in the Bi@@ omet@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bus inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ion exchange region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly split@@ ting the bind of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with serum from patients with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cytes proliferation .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by extending the ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was followed below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be added and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re @-@ evaluation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolic pathway resulting from the split@@ ting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children 6 years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm , or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin differs very slightly from insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin @-@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin li@@ sp@@ ro was found .
in adults with type 2 diabetes decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be administered as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the abdominal area .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin in patients with a reduction of liver function can be reduced .
any change of action , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand .
3 . insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic ket@@ o@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment diagram .
these include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , symp@@ athetic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are the un@@ desirable outcomes known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold welding , cooling and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , fear , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is hes@@ itated to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , resulting in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ tis the effect occurs faster and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male patients aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant met@@ ering range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional @-@ glucose @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 mg / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ m @-@ lowering effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin has twice as fast effects as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ m @-@ lowering effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin .
from the data it was evident that at an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a similar post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin stom@@ p@@ sin was turned 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin delivery is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin @-@ lu@@ ci@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , that was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin , that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin pole in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
