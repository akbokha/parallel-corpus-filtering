<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. vortex thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat severe to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems if oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melt tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are also broken down as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to one another.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared with lauazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the symptoms of patients with a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melt tablets and the solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received ambilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to prevent recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Ambilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar effective as lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled shrinkage), tremor (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I-disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazole, were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. an approval for the placing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and related manic episodes to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, independent of meals daily.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, also for treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hyperaemia), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including accelery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, however this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolization, the common application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolization.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Iconconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the dose of ambilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day did not show any significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethysts / 3-Methoxymorphine Ratio), 2C19 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omezzo) and 3A4 (Dextromethysts).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and because of the concerns produced in the reproduction studies of the animal, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - A controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole was reduced overall (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in Olanzzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term study period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment of Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosage, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and to serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergigen and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C raccoprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the Putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of respondents who taught a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Assum- depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapses was achieved for Aripiprazole, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olantin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole did not show superior efficacy in comparison with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase for manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilisation period prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxymethylation by Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolization via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolizers over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did schizophrenic study of schizophrenic patients no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies of safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the candid potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have only limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal infusion carcinomas / carcinomas at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average Steady State Exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate concentrations found in the human bile at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Gall of apes and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold in the mid-range Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify Injection Solution is used for quick control of agility and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated using Aripiprazole injection solution and begin using oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimize variability, an injection is recommended in the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle with circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated by Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify melt tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (either prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hyperaemia), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypoglycemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including accelery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, stiffness, varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating, and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>

<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and bipolar disorder patients due to combination bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect resp. an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) were used as one-off intramuscularly and who at the same time received Lorzepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, however this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">Compared to CYP2D6, the common application with CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolization can result in increased plasma concentrations of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors the dose of ambilify should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% was 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the agility and behavioural problems compared to placebo and similar to the Loracepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value at the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorzepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of respondents who taught a response to study medication in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values of measurement scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement than with haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapses was significantly reduced, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study more than 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study more than 26 weeks followed by a 74 week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization period, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC was 90% bigger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, after giving the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use during systemic exposure (AUC), which were intra-muscular in 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">Safety-related concerns of maternally exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg were observed in studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies using Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canventricular potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="267">The effectiveness of Abraxane was studied in a main study where 460 women with metastatic breast cancer attended, of which about three quarters had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time until disease worsening and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were referring to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophilenots in the blood before or before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs do not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-based therapy is not shown (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophilately &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy Type 3, the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="283">In patients no new abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophilately rose to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly labelled cardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac incident in the indicated patient population is not uncommon, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patient dies after the application of Abraxane nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic drugs and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, besides the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Before treatment, male patients should be advised to receive a sperm conserving because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the ability to transport and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported at 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy have occurred in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally, increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, bloating, tongue burn, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, sore throat, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness, very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an optimising microtubules substance that promotes the containment of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubules network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies have been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendthelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the albuminary protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two unsigned unaffiliated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised common condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastazation and 19% due to metastatic and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line treatment are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Type 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for lowering on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug exposure level (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After using Abraxane with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2, the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with an intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values following a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane gift (43%) compared to a solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the average for cumulative urinary excretion of the unmodified active ingredient was 4% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was proof at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in front of light light protected over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be respected when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile injection, slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into a Abraxane piercing bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the break-through bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the break-through bottle should be swivelled slowly and carefully and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete resuspension of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinuses are visible, the water-through bottle must be inverted again in order to obtain a complete resuspension before application.</seg>

<seg id="357">Member states must ensure that the holder of the permit for the placing on the market is provided with the following information and materials in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies prior to the market launch:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the drug (specialist information), labelling and packaging. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, provided coolboxes for transport by patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that the streamed of a biological medicine is similar that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference medicinal product").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood tests that may occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if an individual blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abscamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and for patients who want to have an own blood donor, Abseamed is to be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received an appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure and for patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a Vene by injection into a Vene as part of a primary study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo to a Vene for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Langstreamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed bottomed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from a renal disease caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to Langstreamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the starting value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The commonest side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Seamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Seamed as injections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, according to the European Union legislation, Abseamed showed that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which produces Abseamed, will provide information on the safety of the drug for the medical staff of all member states, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the marketing of Abseamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction in transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger operational interventions requiring large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood Abseamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall health burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this hemoglobinvariability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is 25% reduced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with a very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose is 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with an increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall health burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this hemoglobinvariability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the column number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the column number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the column number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µl has increased, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) resp. the column number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood caries is required, severed streamed at a dose of 600 I.E. / kg of body weight should be received twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the streamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg of epoetin alfa which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgical procedure and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately after it.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic salt solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythroblastocyanemia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) with some erythropoietin should not receive seamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoopia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following morning, accompanying or underlying disease in patients who are unable to participate in an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoopia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the recticulation value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-response (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminate intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the item value is decreased (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0,5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason for an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and a study of bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous UVital applications in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl. (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributable to the gift of epoetine when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evidence of coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit for haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoietin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transfundated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">If possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly, if possible, before the beginning of epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of an underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Furthermore, it cannot be excluded that in the treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output equivalent of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or decrease the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when haemoglobin target concentration was targeted from 12 to 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporine dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In-vitro examinations of tumor tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">More than thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, atherosclerosis, retarthrombosis, and 11 blood clots were reported in patients with erythropoietin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of the erythropoietin treatment it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically optimized epoetin alfa is glycosilised and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrate percentage are identical with the endogenous human erythropoetin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be demonstrated with the aid of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of recombinant human erythropoietin in tumor patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a haemoglobin value below 13 g / dl since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin alfa regulations after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half-life of about 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than serum levels achieved after IV injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no cumulation: serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are designated 24 hours after the first administration or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture such as falling; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the use of Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache during the three days after the infusion.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies with a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronate for six months (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) normalized in the blood again or decreased at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (excluding osteoporosis medicine) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>

<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia must be treated with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledron acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="634">The total totality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all points of time compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase the BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% on the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), an annual dose of Aclasta was not inferior to the once-weekly administration of alendronate relative to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, predominantly light to moderate Morbus Paget of the bone (middle serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6-fold increase of age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg zoledronate acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once a day during 2 months was proved in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline value for Aclasta and Risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study (responded to therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 with Risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 patients with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, was maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of zoledoeic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ to 1.87 hours, followed by a long eliminatory phase with a terminal elioration period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) presumably represent the fast resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of cytochrome-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because it is not metabolized by cytochrome acid in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) correlated with the creatinin clearing, 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearing, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clér = 50 - 80 ml / min) and excessive kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the cioledronous acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As there is only limited data for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single-dose intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC exceed the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronylic acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, equivalent), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as on the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysical of the long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages starting from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed on rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin, it can be applied to patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acetone treatment, except for hypoglycemia patients (low blood sugar), and the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea and received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effects of the additional administration of acetin and a sulfonylurea in a reduction of HbA1c levels reduced by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who received additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesiology (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react hypersensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in cases where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibilities (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of having at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area are increased, the liver enzyme measurements must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction like e.g. unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be guided by clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters have been performed.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in the average haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematokrhages (relative reduction of 4.1%) was observed under therapy with pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazon in patients under Metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hemoglobin by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with insulin or as a dual-combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment of thiazolidindione, including pioglitazon, about an occurrence or worsening of macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic evaluation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be canceled (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with Pioglitazon reduces the hyperinsulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the mother and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to temporary alteration of the lens and the refraction index of the lens, as seen in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT Anstiege on three times the upper limit of the standard area were equally frequent as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under Metformin or Sulfonylresin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazon or Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction has been rarely reported on heart failure under Pioglitazon, however, more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication was performed.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study that had been running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an effect on the activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with Pioglitazon versus Gliclinazide as monotherapy was continued for over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazon at 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclinazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimizing with insulin was randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin only; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies more than a year, pioglitazon showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin ratio compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetes in a small study of 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as marginally, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo, metformin or licentigrade, and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while lower values were observed under Metformin and Gliclcid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the groin triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups who received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to pre-existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazon is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-exclusion period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearing of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy occured in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with Pioglitazon reduces the Hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal by reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) treatment with two other thiazole-ions resulted in increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patients years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied, each with Pioglitazon or Gliclinzid.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine ratio was statistically significant compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the growers triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation over the ankles, coronary rearthrosis and vascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with taking Pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses are dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx amounts to about 2,8-3,2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient should not lie down until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the Company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE exactly matches the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive tract such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), flatulence (ulcera), ulcers (ulcera), broken abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic dissolution.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any hypersensitivity to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used for esophagus diseases, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or for patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE can only be taken with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following tips are to be followed carefully to reduce the risk of ophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the onset of the day. • Patients should not crush the tablet or dissolve the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for Pyloroplastics, can only be administered with special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal lines, were reported in patients taking alendronate (sometimes these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of osteophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrostaral pain or new or worsening heartburn burn the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take on symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While no increased risk was observed in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimens mainly administered intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available which indicate whether the replacement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after noticing their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs (see Section4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecrosis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients, but also reported about osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, measures of the serum calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Alendronate studies once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) were demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the Phase III studies, the middle intake of BMD with alendronate increased 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femur neck and 7.8% on the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with alendronate a reduction of 48% (alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.2%) was achieved in the percentage of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of BMD of spine and trochanter continued; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies, in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continued to be either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily administration of alendronate reduced the incidence of at least a new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption to an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg following nightly fast and two hours before intake of a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Osteoporosis was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average by 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies of rats revealed that alendronate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intravenous intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly circulated into the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fences.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearing of alendronate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearances did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronate is not secreted by the kidneys via the acid or alkaline transport system and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of advant with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or re-uptake of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and examined how advant is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dose; changes to the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close control of a doctor experienced in the transplant (see Section4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a change to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>

<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraph, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 systemic exposure was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of tacrolimus blood levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advant to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-cleared substance, an adaption of the advant can take several days to reach the Steady State.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of the application For suppressing the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance Therapy should begin at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be necessary, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance Therapy should begin at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must a recipient of two daily doses of Prograf capsules must be converted to a once daily intake of advant, so this conversion has to take place at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressant to advant once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must begin with the recommended oral and liver transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are converted to advant, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day can be taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience in lung, pancreatic and intestine transplanted patients, had an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in patients with reduced liver function for patients with reduced liver function may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum, a calculation of the creatinoxin, and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Change from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Section4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred-tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talmus during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-level levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after modifying prograf to advant, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent use of substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels in the blood are not exceeding 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually within 5 - 20 ng / ml in the first time after liver transplantation - and heart transplant patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; renditionations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close control of a doctor experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data are available for the retarated formulation of advant.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For the prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and pedigrees in childhood, no clinical data are available for the retaraging formulation of advant.</seg>
<seg id="1443">The use of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during treatment with advant can be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is necessary, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, Prograf was considered to be a cardiomyopathy referred to as a chamber or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore occur also in advant.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid pollution and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothes or using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent concentrations (see Section4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus can be metabolized by CYP3A4, which can affect metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thereby increase hormonal exposure, decisions regarding contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal testing have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible adverse effects of tacrolimus (especially concerning its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of associated Nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppressive therapy, including therapy with advant.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in conjunction with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On a molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosolian protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the compound in the cell inside.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells, dependent on T-helper cells, and the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advance Group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf Group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1473">The patient survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for advance and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advance Arm 25 (14 women, 11 men) and in the Prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of advant and prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, with 667 de novo kidney transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The patient survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for advance and 97,5% for Prograf; in the Advance Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Prograf Arm 8 (3 females, 5 men) occurred deaths.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advance was compared with Basiliximab-antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids, with 638 de novo kidney transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Advance Group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf Group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advent Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advance vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily Prograf capsules after other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant for pancreas, pulmonary and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 untransplanted patients, in 475 patients undergoing pancreatic transplantation and used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases after an intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf was consistent with these published studies in the large studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplants as primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multicenter study with oral prograf was reported about 110 patients who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">Survival rate after one year was 80,8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis was up to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the tacrolimus group patients (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter trial with oral Prograf was performed in 205 patients who underwent pancreas and kidney transplants, which were randomized using Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the targeted levels of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a primary immunosuppressant with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant following intestinal transplantation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional administration of interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower starting doses of Tacrolimus, leading to Talmud (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with corticosteroids, will be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion mainly occurs over the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus-Talmus during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarated formulation of advant.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid pollution and edema.</seg>

<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII-defect, on location and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified amount of plasma (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma crucible is recommended to control the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.E. should be given by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed to verify an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition, with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) versus Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directional IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the magnitude of exposure to Factor VIII, although the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestic known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-tighter) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has maintained the benefit-risk assessment further as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which makes a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for permission to use advin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus can not trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advin could have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the p53 gene existing in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions he had asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on examining the initial documents submitted, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the Injection of Advexin in Li-Frauferi-Tumore benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advancements can be established in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who are in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other slowly releases over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aeronaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nose pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents under 12 years of age, the recommended dose of averages is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy was the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms besides constipation of the nose, patients who received aeronaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aeronaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth drought, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aero may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components, against adrenergic active agents or Loratadin (other medicines for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze may also not be used in patients suffering from a bottangle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy) or a haemorrhagic stroke (caused by brain bleeding) or have a risk of hemorrhagic strokes.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of aeronaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but must be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeronaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms cease.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aeronaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks after such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoid, dimethotergotamine or other deongestions which are peroral or nasal than swaying rhinologics (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aeronaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or strengthening of headache) must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder soobstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aero aze must be disposed of at least 48 hours before the completion of dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor testing no significant differences could be found between patients treated with desloratadin and those treated with placebo, irrespective of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines can not be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin did not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the use of aero during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not raise the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, it may result in a dizziness that may result in impairment of the traffic fatness or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letteries.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precoronary pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil starre and - dilatation, skin consolation, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of P-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aero tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall results of the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aeronaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">In terms of sex, age or ethnicity, the efficacy of aeronaze tablets did not show any significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of pharmacokinetics of aeronaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration of plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aeronaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were badly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine has been bioequivalent to exposure to an Aeronaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated use, gene otoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the approval application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 ml. of syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruped, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after 6 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were considered, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria the decrease of the symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms cease and resume after reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the case of persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuous treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically-pharmacological study the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that it may occur in very rare cases, which may lead to impairment of the traffic fatness or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 juvenile patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-selectant's adhesion molecules on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance, including amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tearing and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the total core of the questionnaire about the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for other forms of urticaria as the underlying pathophysiology notwithstanding the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited more easily.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histaminfomination is an causative factor in all urticaria diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also improves symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering of size and number of quads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin did not inhibit CYP2D6 in vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with desloratadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of desloratadin and lauatadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies of safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1765">Besides the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomic anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher levels of substance (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomatic insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinically-pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose was 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged 1 to 11 who came into question for antihistamine therapy received daily deslordosis duration of 1.25 mg (between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents where desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and lowering of size and number of quads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than for Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The strain (AUC) by desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant active compound concentrations according to once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 Recommended dosage studies showed that the AUC- and CMAx values of desloratadin in pediatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup at a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">By administering the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">"" "subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus was cleaned up with the" "" "surface antigens" "" "(proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a foreign body), cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine." ""</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection from some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the EMEA for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, as the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be classified if the doctor has checked what antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with 100 mg of knight avir and other antiviral medicines twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when used in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Agenerase, which was strengthened with low-dose knight avir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml compared to placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the increased viral load after 16-week treatment was just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a stronger residual of the viral load after four weeks as in patients who continued to receive their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Airritase (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are broken down just like Agenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (the death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors outweigh the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee found that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors was not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited an approval for the placing of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Amprenavir should be administered together with low doses of knight avir (see Section4.2 and 4.5) for pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the patient's pretreatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of knight avir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of knight avir (booster), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of knight avir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be carried out with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function problems, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given concurrently with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generic capsules should usually be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who are suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these drugs at the same time, asterase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if low doses of knight avir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoll content of the Agerase solution for inclusion, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with care in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be canceled for a duration of 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy drugs which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors associated with a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, which lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is assumed (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given concurrently with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also show substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir may not be given along with medicines whose active agents are metabolised mainly via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance evolution.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to balance the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with knight avir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already adopts St. John's wort, the amprenatal virus and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for CMAx being reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, confirming the efficacy and safety of this regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The cimin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to monitor closely, since the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for the use of Agenerosin in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antazian component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma crucible.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be undertaken, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and knight avir on delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentrations (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, since it can cause resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, Niccardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased 10 by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent intake with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors related side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolite is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected to increase plasma levels while administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma sampling of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilising the mirror is recommended since plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while adding amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with orally recorded midazolam (see Section 4.3), while careful use of asgenerase with parenteral midazolam is required.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on Opiate withdrawal symptoms, particularly if low doses of knight avir are also administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the very low reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt the amprenavirus dose if amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In combination with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International normised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while adding Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in lactation of lactation, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the implantation in the uterus to the end of lactation of amprenavir, showed a diminished increase of the 12 body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, compacted early and rarely resulted in the termination of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are related to the use of Agenerase or any other medicines at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials (PROJ3001, PROAB3006), in which proteasepics did not receive pre-treated patients 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed at more than 1% of patients, and laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (sticking).</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113 antiretroviral individuals who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over an average duration of 36 weeks, only one case (bull's) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 NRTIs showed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir in combination with different NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rash usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapule nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients receiving 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low-dose knight avir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception was the increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received Agenerase together with low-dose knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient must be observed on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral gene and gag pol- polysis pre-stages with the result of an unmature, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro to HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir-based regimens with protease inhibitors - these mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients receiving 1,700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of knight avir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients with protease inhibitors occurred in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic testing systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / knight avir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutation V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / M / S, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic samples produces a certain cross resistance against knight avir, sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all four Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not previously treated patients, in which a Fosamprenatal virus failed (one of which demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates), and tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that may have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which adults treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI, and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group with regard to time-adjusted average variation of the baseline value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subliminal threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agerase was tested three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose knight avir was given at the same time; the majority of the patients treated with PI had previously obtained at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unbiased" "" "Agenerase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for CMAx lowered by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after metering (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be close to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unconnected amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State via the range of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">This is why medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or introduce a substrate from CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see Section4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; hence, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These schemata lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without simultaneously administering Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas complied with dosages containing the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, gave little indication of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo and in-vitro gene otoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutations tests, mouse lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagen, nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily routine by measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical studies, either during the administration of Agenerase or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">However, with a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes, which point to delayed development, were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcing addition of knight avir (booster), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be carried out with care in patients with weak or slight liver function problems, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Norised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be canceled for a duration of 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance evolution.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, for CMAx being reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The cimin values of amprenavir in plasma that were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to monitor closely, since the effectiveness and harmlessness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended since exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be undertaken, as an accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and knight avir on delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, Niccardipin, Nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In combination with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International normised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmine of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the implantation in the uterus to the end of lactation of amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient must be observed on signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro to HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefit of "unbiased" Agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of PI pre-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unconnected amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Steady State over the range of CMAx, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">This is why medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or introduce a substrate from CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given simultaneously with Agenerase (see Section4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2090">The renal clearing of Ritonavir is also negligible; therefore, the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2091">In long-term studies for carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred with dosages containing the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans after two daily doses of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not achievable after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the treatment of the Feignizen (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most common reported and likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimodine cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported at 185 with Imiquimodine-creme from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial were shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimodine-cream, was a reaction of the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimodine) in these studies.</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimodine-creme are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs, according to the protocol, shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine cream often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / leaf / slipping (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs, according to the protocol, shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine spread often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scoring and scrusting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of Imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically severe side effect, which occurred after several oral dosages of &gt; 200 mg, consisted in hypotony normalized after oral or IV hydration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected following the topical application of Imiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior regarding a complete healing of the readiness for an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients who treated with Imiquimod completely healed the patients; this was in 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histological confirmed single primary supernormal basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimodine at three times weekly use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external tilt warts, actinic keratosis and supernormal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supernormal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg CG resulted in significantly lowered body weight and increased spleen weight; a study of the dermal application carried out for four months did not reveal any similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice during malignant administration of three days a week did not induce tumors at the point of use.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or hospital with revitation equipment, and patients may need medicines to prevent an allergic reaction prior to administration.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was focused mainly on the safety of the drug, but it has also measured its effectiveness (by examining its efficacy in reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyms in patients aged over five years (observed with more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion area.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitively (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be disclosed and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzymatic therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been established, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not identified, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all of the patients are IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in resuming treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously preceded by an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or anti-pyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a slight or moderate infusion-induced reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular incorporation of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborn babies who have been exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during the phase-3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table following the following frequency (≥ 1 / 10); commonly (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, breath stillness and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe trial and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a serokonaversion occurred within 3 months of the start of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of 5 most often came to a serum version within one month (on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection from the study) 13 / 45 patients were not able to detect antibodies using radioimmunohistories (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients who had never come to Serokonaversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzymatic therapy lies in a recovery of enzyme activity which is sufficient for hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study covering the entire range of disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had an accelerated expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6 minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms every week for a further 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability to work with Aldurazyme, presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volume increased further in proportion to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomic loss before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease of the GAG-level was found in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin), which remained constant up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was considered clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of movement of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change was observed in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A year-old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe forms of circulation and 4 with the mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was observed according to the Z-score for this age group. younger patients with the severe form of circulation (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe forms of circulation, only limited or no advances in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, research on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing schemes was performed on GAG levels in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that is available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional safety spharmacology studies, toxicity in a unique gift, toxicity in repeated dose and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a primary study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared with gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells had longer survival times in the administration of Alimta compared to the same medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the placing of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the penetration bottle and diluted with 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with loc- or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after the conclusion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed Gift as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetreq, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period and for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed should a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the nadirs of the blood pattern or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of predictive treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be terminated if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose-reductio- or so-on at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65, or above, there is an increased side effect risk in comparison to patients aged 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, exceeding the dose adaptions recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-times the upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; to 3.0-fold the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically investigated in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone marrow suppression and Pemetrexed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophilately reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number again has reached a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophilately, thrombocyte count and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of the level 3 / 4 hematological and nichological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 took place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetreq must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measures to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for whom treatment with Pemetrexed is foreseen, must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the ergometer is to be weighed prior to the Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported occasionally in clinical trials with Pemetrexed, if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible injury of the reproductive ability by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the retention of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to decreased Pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid can be avoided in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs are available with a long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International normised Ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but severe birth defects are expected in case of an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, unless it is obligatory and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive ability by means of Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservience.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and were randomized with mesothelioma and in 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomized crisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Frequency indications: very common (≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000) and not known (based on available data of spontaneous reports).</seg>

<seg id="2419">Clinically relevant laboratory toxicity degree 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the pooled results of three single patients (n = 164), except neutropenia (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in the Alanine transaminase (15.2% compared with 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population because the Pha- se 2 studies included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests.</seg>
<seg id="2421">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could possibly be related to study medication; they were reported at &gt; 5% of 839 patients with NSCLC who received randomised cisplatin and Pemetremixed and 830 patients with NSCLC who received randomised cisplatin and gemcitabine.</seg>

<seg id="2429">Cases of acute renal failure in Pemetrexed Monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs were reported (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiating pneumonitis in patients were reported before, during or after their pemetremixed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic anti-folate which performs its effect by interrupting important and acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as anti-folate with multiple attack points by blocking the thyme dylatase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomised, simple-blind, Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma, showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of median 2.8-months prolonged survival compared to those patients who were treated with cisplatin only.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement in clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms of treatment resulted in an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open Phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy achieved median survival of 8.3 months in patients with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the overall survival occurred in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 399, 9.3 vs. 7.4 months, adapted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2.26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separately randomised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) prior treatment are similar to docetaxel.</seg>

<seg id="2500">Detach the content of the 100 mg dose bottles with 4.2ml 0.9% of sodium chloride solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Dissolve the contents of the 500 mg dose bottle containing 20 ml 0.9% of sodium chloride solution (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the colouring ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish yellow without compromising the quality of the product.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low-calorie, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who are allergic to Alli and do not lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise certain fats in the food, causing approximately a quarter of the fats fed to food undigested to the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took alli 60 mg. after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study of allergy in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of allergy (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on the anus, flatus (winch) with faeces, faeces, greasy / oily stool, ecal secretion (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It may not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplants) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited company a permit for the placing of orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction in adults with excess weight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypothetical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is resorbed to minimal absorption, elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function do not need to adapt the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Prevent time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Section4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment, because the dosage of the antidiabetic may need to be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional precautionary measures to prevent possible failure of the oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range remained.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a single dose Amiodarone, a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time observed a slight decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are primarily gastrointestinal and are associated with the pharmacological effects of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight people without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be traced back to the lip-inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect activates in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastric and pankeratic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat is taken three times a day to block the absorption of approximately 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypothetical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (starting value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (starting value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3,5% (starting value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (starting value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average amendment was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Laconring) and M3 (M1 after splitting of the N-Formyl-leucine-group), were identified in a study with obese patients showing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety spharmacology, toxicity in repeated use, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data will not be able to detect particular danger for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2547">Pharmacovigilance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmacovigilance system, as described in the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.8.1. of the application order, is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2570">You can find out more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 on how to set your calory spots and fetal boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you omit a meal or if a meal contains no fat, take no capsule. alli can only work if the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat, you risk diet-related side effects (see Section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start with a calorie and fat-reduced diet before the first capsule is taken.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutrition notes are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to achieve your target weight, you should set two daily goals in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Do eat fatted to reduce the likelihood of diet-related side effects (see Section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not accustomed to physical activity. • Do stay physically active while taking and also after the seizure of alli.</seg>

<seg id="2583">29 Very frequent side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 people who take alli. • flatulence (flatulence) with and without oily exit • Soft chair Informing your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects is amplified or you significantly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2584">Frequent side effects These may occur in 1 out of 10 people who take alli. • Gastric (abdominal) pain, • Inkontinenz (chair) • aqueous / liquid stool • Increased bowel cravings • Deflect your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects is amplified or you significantly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur. • Increasing specific liver enzymes - effects on blood clotting in patients who use warfarin or other blood-diluting (anticoagulating) medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, since at this time you may have not consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: • Start some days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a substantial dessert, as you might have done with other programs for weight reduction. • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control them over time by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep out of reach of children. • Do not store alli after the expiry date indicated on the box. • Keep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silicones, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Do not swallow it. • You can take your daily dose alli in the blue transport box (shuttle) that is included in this package.</seg>

<seg id="2595">Obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as: • high blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Certain cancers • Osteoarthritis talks to your doctor about your risk for these diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Permanent weight loss, for example by improving diet and more exercise, can prevent the onset of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you can also find as an indication of food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Take a look at the information below that indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you. • Due to the mode of action of the capsule, compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to the recommended fat intake, you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reducing the likelihood of diet-related side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced caloric intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher is your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you exercise every day only little or no more, work in the garden or do other physical activities. • "Medium physical activity" means that you can burn 150 kcal every day, i.e. through 3 km of walking, 30- to 45-minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat goals and keep them. • Matter is a nutrition journal with information on the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nourish calorie and fat levels and give guidelines to become more physically active.</seg>
<seg id="2607">In combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss, this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight.</seg>
<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1,842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 from 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the placing of Aloxi in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestial obstination or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required in the simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or that tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi will not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with aloxi, headache (9%) and autopsy (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alopia overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 750 mcg. of dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given on day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG impact of low-dose palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the whole dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV dispensing of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once daily intravenous administration of 0.75 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to that of a single intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after one-time consumption of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchangeable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy patients, the total body unit was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing was 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination of the terminations and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron increases, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, indications suggesting that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation and increase the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily for over two years, led to increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the used high doses and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the CHMP Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report recommending the use of Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injectable medication for the placing of the approval for the placing of the medicine intended for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should be similar to a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damage damages, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine amotransferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast, in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates this to the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the Reference Pharmaceutical in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 out of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set up (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C that responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After treatment with Alpheon, the disease returned to more patients than with the reference medicinal product; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the study used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine dissolves an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected dormers (cracking or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that were demonstrably or presumably caused by methiciline-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo does not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used for patients from the age of nine months, but for patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced), thereby inhibiting the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection occured at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">139 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were considered by skin patients, about 90% of patients in both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation to the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were outweighed against the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or severe local irritation by applying retapamulin ointment the treatment should be stopped, the ointment should be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials for secondary wounds the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which have been achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole, the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment increased by 81% on the skinned skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, doses adjustments are not required if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on effects on birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether the breastfeeding should continue / terminate or continue the therapy with Altargo is to weigh between the benefits of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the place of administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Function Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosome protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosome P-binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibiting peptide transfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50s ribosome subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retininulin might seem questionable at at least some infection forms, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retininulin compared to S.aureus, irrespective of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of a non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on peened skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% retininulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 skinned skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retininulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinopathy in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility with oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, thus reaching up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skinned skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The owner of the permit for the placing on the market commits itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP will be submitted to the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area will show you to quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if you are not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these areas, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is being used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, potentially preventing hepatitis B after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunization process, ensuring that the vaccine can be managed from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose of hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defence), as it can resist a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine Twin in 1996, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect them against the same diseases, but Twinxes and Twinxes are given as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinmatrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinet adults were also used as evidence for using Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix performed between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, mating (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the placing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for Primmuncization with Ambirix is made up of two doses of vaccine, taking the first dose at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated with the appropriate monoovary vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-Hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same as after vaccination with the respective monoovary vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully ensured if immunological individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination need to have a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all vaccines, an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, containing 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value, so that in these cases the gift of further doses of vaccine can be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2746">These injections should be avoided as an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, Ambirix can be injected subcutanely in thrombocytopenia or blood clots as it can result in hemorrhages after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza-rubbing vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is necessary to assume that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, mating, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomery and preservatives-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 Vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 up to and including 15 years the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matchiness on a calculation basis per Vaccine Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects following the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the patients who had received Ambirix had reported pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of mating was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pronounced pain and matchiness was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed in conjunction with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years, serum conversions for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the dose of the 3-dose vaccine higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses that have been achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year-olds after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitisan A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds one could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix was administered in the second year at the same time with the onset of a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenza-rubbing-rubbing vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults pointed to the current formulation of similar seroprotective and seroconversion rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after resorting to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend to you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per inoculation dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and may give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2799">Other side effects that were reported for days or weeks following vaccination with comparable combination or individual vaccines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inked doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally limited or extended kicks that can be itchy or can be convex, swelling of the eyes and face, scary breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and loss of consciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was launched only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient's exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonrapes- split by several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered by a gastroenterial (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonia could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, flavoring or tachiness, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonia was permitted under "exceptional circumstances" because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval it was only limited information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of enzymatic deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a latinic form (incomplete enzyme that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein uptake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornicotinscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine at a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk of the formation of oesophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be applied only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown in neuronal propagation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It was not possible to determine whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one adverse event (AE) occurred at 56% of the patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate can, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which in intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore also suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be thought to be produced for each gram of assimilated sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease himself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga in the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first treatment of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time for many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with heterozygote form of the orninozzle transcarbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and were then permanently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cykline disruptions or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma after nightly fastings.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis that were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma crucible were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The drug is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrate did not have a toxic effect in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children who do not yet swallow pill or patients with swallowing) or via a gastroenterial or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborn babies, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornicotinscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required at a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contain 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before birth, phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramidal cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate can, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Biometrically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the secretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle it can be assumed that for each gram of assimilated sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granule form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">For this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon weighs 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to get the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyl rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot secrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">When laboratory tests are carried out, inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation period, you should not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, flavoring, disinfection of the ear, disoridity, memory disturbances and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency call of your hospital for the purpose of initiating a corresponding treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2878">31 • Remove from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Serve a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess pellet. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring scoop. • Remove the recommended number of measuring scoop from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with any dose or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient frequently used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as cximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or a year in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization).</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin in terms of all indicators except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox cannot be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other milepudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the marketing of angioxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of an emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous rejection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be added and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous stun of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single case of angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt should be 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with bivalirudin treated against ACS or not), lower infusion rates of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT score is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is re-examined 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which was approved for authorisation, the ACT value was 5 minutes after administration of the bivalirudin Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous formulation of lower molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against herbacine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible vascular endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of arterial hemorrhages occur in the case of PCI patients under bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can, in principle, occur everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring the INR value (International Standard ised Ratio) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after discontinuation of treatment with Bivalirudin once again reaches the level existing before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the action mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregate inhibitors) it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregate inhibitors or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are insufficient regarding the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Biovirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group and in patients treated with heparin were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi for severe bleeding such as in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intramuscular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reducing the hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with a well-known hemoglobin level, reoperation due to bleeding, using blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding disturbances that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI examination.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Biometirudin group and in patients treated with heparin were more common in women as well as for patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above were reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken down and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombus inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as on the ion exchange region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin is slowly splitting the bind of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum from patients with thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce thrombocytes proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is covered by extending the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was followed below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin should be added and the infusion for the duration of the procedure is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were evenly distributed across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKC changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children 6 years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm, or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lucisin differs very slightly from insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting insulin-insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lispro was found.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes decreased the HbA1c concentration 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be administered as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin in patients with a reduction of liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when switching the treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="2983">These include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylate and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, sympathetic drugs such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine can be alleviated or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not enter into breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable outcomes known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cooling and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, fear, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, lightheadedness, excessive dog-ger, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is hesitated to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, resulting in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucoagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to investigate the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose (especially skeletal musculature and fat) and inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lucitis the effect occurs faster and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male patients aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic relevant metering range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a proportional-glucose-lowering effect, and at 0.3 mg / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucosm-lowering effect, just like the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lucisin has twice as fast effects as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosm-lowering effect approximately 2 hours earlier than the human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that at an application of insulin-lucisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar postprandial glycaemic control is achieved, like with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin stompsin was turned 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin delivery is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control such as with a human normal insulin, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lucisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, that was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin, that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
