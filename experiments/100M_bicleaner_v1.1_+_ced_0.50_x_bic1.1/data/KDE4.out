the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or by making them more readily available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the map tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on Tools File . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crashed , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the View filter module ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) is available in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter the current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , sample : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles feature meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View color mode , can display either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( whereby therefore display errors can occur by constraints on the mark of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps in Tre@@ em@@ ap , the rule should be observed that the area is proportion@@ ate to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . it will draw the frame to display the ne@@ sting of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how split@@ ting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is possible for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through the frame to divide the rect@@ angles which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can design@@ ate the minim@@ ally represented area for an entry on the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the associated entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Photo Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you visit the image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per line has a slider and a field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the image file name of the image , show whether the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
if you want to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , show whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the File menu Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the sub@@ folder check box , you can set a slider to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
you can copy the original pictures to the gallery using the original pictures .
to use the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can set a different colour depth for the thumb@@ nail pictures than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ h ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ously ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to make reporting problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry problems or requests reports .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined short@@ cut . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . all required information is already entered here . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developer are helping each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of &amp; digi@@ cam . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to get started &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ arrived ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ code ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter here a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data will be saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ Library . settings digi@@ code set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during browsing the folders you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ cam ; searches recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting one point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ code your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ word List to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , digi@@ cam can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; it may also handle it . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in &amp; digi@@ h ; -@@ albums can be downloaded . of course , every medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; used the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails from digi@@ cam can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be seen or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about digi@@ cam : how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier to digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in &amp; digi@@ cam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping images works everywhere : you can put an image in a different part of the al@@ b tree , above the horizontal partition or another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently being displayed in the icon view . so filtering on the file name will only work if it is shown in the symbol view . which fields will be displayed in the dialog box settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ list quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ cam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the al@@ ben characteristics or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Import screen shot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection . to access the album features , right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you choose collection from the tool@@ bar or sort out albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
buttons elder , average , new : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do so , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ y ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ bridge quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu . additionally , you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; support the input of key words for individual photos in the My Key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate thumb@@ nails .
information on each picture is displayed below the appropriate preview . what information this is can be edited by editing ; set up the albums page and customize the preview pictures to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all tags of a picture . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ cam ; go . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements . you can select all the functions that come with &amp; digi@@ code . you have the choice between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the right mouse button or the right @-@ click context menu . in the editing section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contex@@ tual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . to do this , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after working with other image editing programs , it can cause problems with the metadata in the picture . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way to right @-@ click on the preview and to select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ h ; delete it , it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
when you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ words column ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are re @-@ imported when &amp; digi@@ cam is lost ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or on an existing keyword , and then choose New Key@@ word . if you have a new keyword , after you click on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the option to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch quot ; .
to select a different photo as an album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to add with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch &amp; quot ; . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords associated with it . in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select removing from the menu @-@ menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows an adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection , which appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
Neb@@ ras@@ er search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds matches . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its contex@@ tual menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information . if you select to edit an advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ var ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . one option can be added to this list with search group / deleted or deleted from it . each option can be associated with other via the logical operations of all ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ cam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can let each picture fall to find a similar . by means of a si@@ ll , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hands @-@ on sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ code ; find the right pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble thumb@@ nail . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you press the left mouse button .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ fix .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that lets you easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Cre@@ ate the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window open . once you are in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main windows are , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview tool@@ bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ize preview from the tool@@ bar and execute Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then they are also executed with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture sequence . if you use pairing mode from the tool bar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . now use the left mouse button on any preview screen to display it in the right @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures to work through .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview , then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom function works just like in other views . just use the zoom regulator in the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in preview mode .
digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , plot@@ ting , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ers and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment .
dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will need to find a certain photo without continu@@ ance management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ code ; . the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if other access to your photos should be whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes pile handling easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the metadata to be saved in &amp; digi@@ code settings in the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? for this , digi@@ cam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign words , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start the best with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in further work .
let &apos;s now use keywords , keywords , as you often do in other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key words , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically set the tree for you or paste the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very crude representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at speed of light .
the possibilities to make use of ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips with Google Earth using images . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
this field contains the name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ o to the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled in .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they offer no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this , in the image embedded metadata . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , those cau@@ tious ones need to be handled and you may not be trusted for longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if they have just been written . that is why they use a control hum@@ ming mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control h@@ amm@@ ers . despite this massive protection , they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that appears to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disc can store 50@@ GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu @-@ ray Disk .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media again to check for you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the defects identified by S@@ MA@@ RT tell the imminent failure . this is especially reading errors and swap counters . the expected lifetime value is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the total loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems .
while most electric appliances do not matter much , it looks different with computer chips and high @-@ speed sensor devices . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able result that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . remember that not each connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it offers protection against flash handling and protects properly connected devices .
since over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected . some manufacturers produce over@@ voltage prot@@ ectors , which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the television adapter .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than and euro ; at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow for this .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r more . for $ 25 per year , you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data protection . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the big companies contain a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . nobody seems ever to have thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data pathway than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle started his own initiative with his b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel yet .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the loss of data on the not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks are already the share of the@@ fts 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . meaning that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit to this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighbouring house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the one @-@ to @-@ one backup and the last difference lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple sn@@ ap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike Script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .

in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time flies . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . remain with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability with you and placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk was recognized by the system , but do not hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in M@@ B@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier every year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment in hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the video formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and comm@@ its to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP is for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive the original image , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems with the connection between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds , and informative efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with digi@@ code ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn on it . for more information , see the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . for some cameras it can take a while . some cameras do not display preview images . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for your application will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as with the metadata page strip from the main window of &amp; digi@@ cam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from your camera in a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download Sel@@ ected until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been digi@@ ti@@ sed until now ; in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download or download the selected albums , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos will be stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums chapter . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them by clicking the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , then you have to select them first and use Del@@ ete Sel@@ ected .
note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ h ; album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera file , you should do so via the camera menu as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to include in the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y % H : % M : % M : % M : % M in the editing field . turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in capital letters if you prefer .
the new file name , which is digi@@ ously ; for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Enh@@ anced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date at which the photo was made , &amp; digi@@ cam ; use this to automatically create sub albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a section , you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in that case &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced Button and select the option date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer on your camera is the button download . select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ code ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the pictures will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users want to locate the location of the photos , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle strings and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon D@@ CS Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are several programs for Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other dates , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign posted coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ h . to access these settings , you need to change the settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ code ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should be the professional title of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name of the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be listed here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ cam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ cam ; without going lost .
image descriptions can be saved as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that will appear when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size , you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and bright color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it means that the images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TI@@ FF files , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF ima@@ gery . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF image . it does not affect the image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting loss@@ less J@@ PEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ loss setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal J@@ PEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ cam , editing was just a picture viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast developing into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
if you use this option , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a passing white . use the setting to trigger some unusual results , as it shows the top lights in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast filling as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w are therefore trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet un@@ filled blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when selecting the re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done in the image options of the digi@@ cam ; image processing . to keep the time for the vo@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ invo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and that a matrix of colored pixels is available . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for correc@@ ting the color , since it is performed during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; information like the color information from a color space to translate into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Provi@@ de here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ cam ; examine this folder then during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for storing your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color ad@@ ministers not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include h@@ ue mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile you can em@@ ulate on how to print your picture from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these are then edited by &amp; digi@@ code ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes activate the metadata that are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features appear on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button auto detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the display mode .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / version , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can view the conversation of &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly controlled by &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you must save the changes using the button &apos; Chan@@ ges &apos; button .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ code the display of the greeting image ; this speeds up &amp; digi@@ plug the start process under certain circumstances .
the Set@@ ting Start after new photos is forcing &amp; dig@@ ging ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ cam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar &apos;s preferences panel . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view and review your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of previ@@ ew@@ ing and selecting the entry / editing .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save file or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you did not save the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button The button Rec@@ over the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have taken in the photo since the last store .
almost every action in the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . undo the last action by selecting Edit undo / restore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and mem@@ ori@@ ze C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the viewing menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can also change the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t want this , you can call it in the Edit &amp; digi@@ code Settings dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . entire picture preview pages can be selected from your selection . you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Ex@@ ports Print Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or just switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
next to the Apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; digital session .
the Key@@ word Tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword in the search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering the keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are saved to the keyword keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a sample with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the keyword trap filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views is used . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard tags . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is written on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in settings different .
if you have a rule with and have created and determine that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and the rule range .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ cam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ administered workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner that have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed and sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ administered workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme is on color management , everyone would like to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow ful@@ fills all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other picture expenses are by email or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why use a different color space and thus have to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB animation compared to the colours we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB runs on your monitor . when you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you must either calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting more manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , Automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ tive Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the lumin@@ ous values over the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot becomes as bri@@ ghter as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
same : this method uses the lumin@@ ous re@@ actor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the same results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wi@@ dest possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ sting of all values in between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance from &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited since you work over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can move too far from the original image areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original image again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic is changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result shown in white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load again later .
the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used J@@ PEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG formats .
this tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images . it uses the change and allocation of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the Color Manager chapter .
another important tool is to find in the menu under color tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ cam ; tool colour effects provide four colour effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by expos@@ ing a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completing the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the picture . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity is controlled by the ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and with it a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of your photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under color . all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview . once you are happy with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on sound correction to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the application purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph are three slides into which can be cli@@ cked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the knob and watch how the image changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called gam@@ ma@@ ges .
the three color twe@@ ets can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow selecting manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can , for example , be used to create a ble@@ ached image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and relo@@ aded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input will be automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the results of the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator lets you check all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photograph . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left @-@ hand side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically adjusted depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available :
modified Channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ ature to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade , medium and sun@@ tan . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color nu@@ ances of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images . you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and output . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the ey@@ eb@@ row . colour bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the noise first .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for that purpose . you can store any bl@@ ender settings for later and then load them . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator lets you check all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance flag is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate phases of the moon at the time of the day .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epitheli@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a little col@@ dness in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ der@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ xing tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper of tex@@ tu@@ ality has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed one ( 2 ) to see . the relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add an image .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the eye .
type : with this parameter you will set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , ed@@ ged it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool according to the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template apply you can put a template on a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mail list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob magni@@ fies the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button res@@ ets the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you have to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it does here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process paints with only minimal differences to a color point . elements that are smaller than the resolution thus are combined to a common color . this in turn results in sharp edges to be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for home users .
in J@@ PEG images a camera is often used in internal sharp@@ ness . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a field filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you get control over your picture .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing ke@@ ying ke@@ g . you can use the menu entry for more correc@@ tive sharp@@ ness .
however , you should carefully circum@@ vent this because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique to focus an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can achieve it via the menu entry Cor@@ rection . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for the sof@@ ter sign with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ant sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool for removing v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates will produce near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount applied . this allows a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixels . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels , causing unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most images the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a good value is 0.@@ 03 .
g@@ auss &apos; sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s edge . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for that purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Fil@@ ters . practically the result of the FI@@ R Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English below this address .
the knob alters the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab@@ s smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
attention to detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the picture . whereas larger values are mainly smoo@@ thing areas and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should preserve detail in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be necessary retro@@ spec@@ tively .
directional Ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions while a value suggests 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . J@@ PEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing over all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm goes through . usually , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ width since &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles create a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only small , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons make exactly this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and relo@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
below you can see how image errors with small arti@@ facts are corrected . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there &apos;s a strange black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by poor film shift during the journey .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel space that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are reset . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or J@@ PEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also bri@@ gh@@ tens the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjusting of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ant sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
J@@ PEG compression : the compression of J@@ PEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Lo@@ ad render exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo restoration is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
below you can reduce how a photo with uniform rou@@ gh@@ ness is restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera was recorded on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photographic paper .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
light , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark@@ picture to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . notice that the wizard shows the last dark image and relo@@ ads it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , they &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ even effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure range of today &apos;s films and the color and grey level of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which results in an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly of a light intensity of 2 , reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a better read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the second degree co@@ efficient treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the fourth grade co@@ efficient correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the intensity of distortion second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree of distortion . this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters have the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positively shr@@ inking the image .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness to the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ n@@ t- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect is evidently the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation C@@ utting out of the image processing or using the Zoom slider to remove this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots of front , frame and paintings , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction on a church in Norway . the original image can be seen at ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to simulate film gran@@ ul@@ arization and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add Film Gran@@ t if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets on your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the movies , the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film distribution effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film distribution effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes lend themselves better for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and smoo@@ thes 17 .
the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engra@@ ver defines your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engra@@ ver is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art with blur@@ ring effects . it uses copyright @-@ protected algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to res@@ ign in the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photograph in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can hold with the digi@@ cam ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirrors or turning . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ers mirrors .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm which is used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . to do this , change ize size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
maintaining aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each inser@@ tion for photo zoom can be saved as text file and relo@@ aded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast at what it does , but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the doubled size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . to cut a photo you simply have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save to the File menu to save the newly @-@ edited photo .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays intact .
in the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater height of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is assigned .
trimm@@ ing the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches , or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ aster aid allow you to show help so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden mean : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the sm@@ el@@ ly sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the gold pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the gold center provides fluid relief lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will help you achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a smooth line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rect@@ angle of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angle is used to create the golden spiral . it should give something to the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can simply be there without directing the eye , it will fulfill its task .
the golden tri@@ angles also diver@@ ge from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can be a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal Options mirror and mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
the Color button lets you set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
when you make a photo , it is easy that you do not hold the camera horizont@@ ally or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation .
turn your image with the slider . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the pres@@ ets button , you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the transformation function transformation cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally Zu@@ Cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the picture a bit after rotation . but keep in mind the warning above .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a little blur@@ red . for a single adaptation , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate twice the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cutting out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module over transformation sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of them with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change the file in the image processing . you can change this list of file extensions and change them . in the configuration section , you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than J@@ PEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the shell format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw @-@ format images in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF with the Digital Image Converter by &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
digi@@ cam ; supports the loading of rough pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ cam ; this is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of rough formats that are edited by &amp; digi@@ code ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore doesn &apos;t have any built @-@ in features to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ code ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start the program for playback .

many tools you need to edit photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ code ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ lock , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp masks , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image .
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal split@@ ting without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical parts . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and lay it on the part of the image you want to view the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble thumb@@ nail . you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . move it while you press the left mouse button .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ let files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can either be applied to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and Rec@@ ently used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue Palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the pal@@ let view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the pal@@ let view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected , you can set this mode by selecting the check box under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with actions to copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the selection of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs with just a few functions according to the program author .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; c@@ low@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing and graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ ima@@ vi@@ z ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Po@@ inter ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; posters ; the graph@@ ene is calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphs inter@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or graph in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graph ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these k@@ not )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which assumes the &amp; graph ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; c@@ low@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; uploaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be relo@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; can also note your decision so that later as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphs viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; c@@ viewer ; instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; c@@ viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog later .
at program start you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the sections of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one graph@@ ene distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the page Renew@@ al Lo@@ ad gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically relo@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask the program every time .
the page opening gives the possibility to define the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which normally appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge @-@ over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ generated graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the jump @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring @-@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multiple grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm prescri@@ bes the k@@ not circul@@ arly according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and print the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; in the Settings menu , you can find more options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette and the grid in which you draw the icon .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created by a template , or if you want to start from scratch .
restore the last undo step . if you have not made any progress , this function is down@@ lighted .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears where you can replace the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button Scan to read the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button Scan@@ nen , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . remember that the BM@@ P type is not compressed and therefore produces very large files . you also need to select the folder and # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the import &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete Desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . thus , it is virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successfully logging in , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . the following page will be presented to you following a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog showing the current access per@@ missions the module displays . to upload , you will need write authori@@ zations . the module currently does not support any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Pictures should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the picture as key words during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lia you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinates system used by GPS and Gali@@ le@@ o . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alisation cor@@ relative . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . to be able to load a possible correlation between time and location , you must load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same time as the images of your camera .
when loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera system must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera pair . if the devi@@ ation below the data is merged , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have matching data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set with this dialog manually . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog changes the coordinates of a call to the next , you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region in question and enlarge it again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the panel has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be selected . the selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the al@@ ben preview and the text displayed in the head of the HTML page will appear .
this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will appear in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export containing everything will be created there .
if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the hor@@ sem@@ an thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oms or sli@@ ps on them . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture will be shown in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a wind@@ owed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in J@@ PEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size is increasing as there is no compression of the color information . for example , this can be found in P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Digital Camera Kli@@ ent currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied to which you have pressed the button OK .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . J@@ PEG is supported in writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , with a defined length . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module through Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you have to select the corresponding PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the rate of the image transition is set below . a low value creates very sudden , high contrast very smooth picture changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file using the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie using the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if an indication appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button settings right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software by your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG Switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion score . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . J@@ PEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tagged Image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use J@@ PEG format , you should not use J@@ PEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata that are included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the J@@ PEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using the button Add images . a preview is shown on the right @-@ hand side for the last selected image .
you can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent .
to remove pictures , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all images , click the OK button to open the new message window of your email client . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select have already been added as attachments .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used again every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format Menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the J@@ PEG format .
if you select J@@ PEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in J@@ PEG format , then the original files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , in the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button closing , you can close this window .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option will show that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option to random@@ ly select images ensures that the images are displayed in random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album .
the distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , any transition between the pictures chooses a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause and start the presentation , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background screen is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with comments . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for themselves .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to set yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to view the image @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu , you can select the image for the respective person . in the viewing window you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you enter searches in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , images where Jes@@ per but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but want to try something like this , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar shows you here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see part of a database by displaying 10 minute sections only .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview button ) and also the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate to the preview screen .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time frame in the preview screen . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . read more about the export files in .
last but not least , you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page , you can set different resolutions for the images . this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 for example .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the root folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so the import function , see , works correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these settings , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name will be set in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have spent a lot of time collecting the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not be done again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ if the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can pass on so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you created when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images , which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when you copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
copying the Automati@@ cally to the .@@ k@@ im file location copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the images will automatically be for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images have been compressed with J@@ PEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders to copy the images you want to import .
it may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of imported file should be imported , and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Speci@@ fying information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and now your videos are taking care of . in many places in this manual we talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where you want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use them in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry preferences k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window that lets you change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be able to explain the different settings .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it has been described in detail how to define different properties for each image , for example people , places and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the Di@@ alogue Options , you can set up complete members groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a middle member as explained in the section .
in the list box you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right one list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; share his module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . more detailed information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be accessed through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other , it may be that the modules were tested with the demo database before using them on your own images . you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help Menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage of sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order after albums for some modules to make use of the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser indicates the content of a category , for example all persons , each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or there will be the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , you will do it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the module to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you and photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window to search for your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the item shown to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to note each picture with notes . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you like , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by using people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can so that the names used are moved up to find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol after date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons , which are located below the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item more entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is an over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new heading or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window by dra@@ gging it out of the window pane .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options ... button that offers among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely out . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and here you can hide / hide windows . see this in the picture .
if you select images in your browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images in case you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply pulling down the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and press the Del@@ ete key or select Edit Sel@@ ection from the Edit menu . now , the window will appear to you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere , so that you can record it in the database index . in the picture you will see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper edge is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy them back . so if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid cl@@ inging your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images .
in the File menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images so that in the end those who wish to make you in@@ accessible and click on the current view bar in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also opt out all the images that your little sister may see , and choose the menu item Clear All except current view .
with this you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you are now giving your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to block images , so that all the images you have locked can be hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password to be entered for un@@ locking the images . to set up this password , simply change your password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to deny the view on private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the image , such as who is in the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image and image below . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus respectively minus keys .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can enter in the image and zoom out . with the mouse button you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oms into the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button , the zoom uses the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
the screen@@ cast functions from the context menu can make you rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can cancel the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one .
the two examples above give the viewer the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in that you press the corresponding letter . in this picture you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so if you have all the images that you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add them all at once with comments . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window . if you can view categories in the Pre@@ view view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see it here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in order to mark the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to make these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will appear with an error description . then , you can correct the input errors and click Apply , or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User Docum@@ entation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a lower part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the pre@@ dict@@ ability level of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different directions .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the p@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to order multiple views over one another , drag the p@@ asser into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map guide at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the p@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the connector bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with window rules ... save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ ders icon The icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View Sc@@ ene Sc@@ ene .
render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or choose R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to indicate the properties of the mode .
in the size chart , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , images with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , compu@@ te and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
what is the difference between abs ( r 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn it on , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have no object .
open a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly quit , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Sc@@ ene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can include source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version here . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data files ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values will result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you want to dial high attention to detail for advanced projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
if you want to display a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you want to display the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick the channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section , you can set the parameters for depth and threshold .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements . in the section of window orders , it explains how to create and save window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector default window arrangement : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the Exist@@ ing window rules list shows all existing window arrangements . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and remove a selected order with the button Rem@@ ove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten to anchor the window under the existing window , with a card card you get a map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you will only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window rules :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tools of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and icons and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but be aware that the camera has control points that you can change to the camera &apos;s target point . simply click with the left mouse button to a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the Apply or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a fa@@ der ( insert end body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ model view also shows the level , even if at the moment it is only a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you view the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
the pig@@ ments will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property tab ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material , because you need to enter settings for the pigment yet . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many options again , but now take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see a color on a rect@@ angle and a sphere in preview , just click the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called single @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
each time you choose one color in the object tree , change the colors in the properties pane :
you should already do this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or button Apply ) , so that the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom to one unit down .
of course the rendering now gives a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ted black material . in the next step , set up a suitable material .
when you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ colored and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the gloss effect and reflection effects already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces even when Met@@ alli@@ c : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er provides . hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer revers@@ es hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er before .
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
once you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last undo command . you can only select this menu item if you have used Edit Un@@ common .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers using this option .
a b@@ ump mapping is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to render the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view with click the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or if all images will always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . when a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can adjust the way of working of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when loading the name of the recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
here &apos;s the short@@ cut for the different modes of display &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays great icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
enlar@@ ges the image by 10 % . the factor relates to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ cam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user makes his part contribute to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of a show photo ; then we would like to encourage you to join the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to take part in a show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to set up the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the exposure indicator field , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity , the colors should be in contrast with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show photo ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sc@@ li@@ lite ; is an application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; sc@@ li@@ sh@@ lite ; is a simple application for scanning images that do not do more than scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ li@@ sh@@ lite ; can open a dialog for each image or save images instantly in a specified folder with auto @-@ generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; with the command sc@@ li@@ tes -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the full preview fits into the window .
when the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en will lead to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog box of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this option allows them to select the type as &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; Save image . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; it will automatically be saved with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select saving without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix of each time it is saved , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression level when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; sc@@ li@@ sh@@ lite ; the button About starts the K@@ DE about dialog for &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; sc@@ li@@ tes .

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used like all other short@@ cuts programs . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting up global short@@ cuts ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands work . thus , you make your keyboard to the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scrip@@ ting .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ Dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ Dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if it has no use .
configure Wei@@ st the script to view the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is launched , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is accumulated . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new piece could be retri@@ eved ( for example , the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Bike contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also given for the script to use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning operations . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script par@@ c@@ els with the cat@@ chy cat@@ er@@ script . for this reason , you should ap@@ point your script par@@ c@@ els properly .
the main script needs to be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the am@@ aro@@ k category ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can &apos;t decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right one for you . and if you still find it hard to decide , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok from the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources :
since &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated with the configure script at compile time . this is a list of options available .
for some of the compile options certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the system requirements section .
activate de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; set up without effort into the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
in addition , if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for the mood bar@@ ometer . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save voice files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
when you want to save playlist by be@@ aming , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible while changing the piece , that the play@@ lists window open / roll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible area of the window .
changing the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray shown section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
selecting Custom color scheme gives you the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
resume play at startup causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last exit .
set up the sub@@ window On @-@ Screen @-@ Display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors do not use , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the Display text input field introduces the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can decide on which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the audio output card output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers will enable even more adjustment options in this flash@@ card .
the File@@ Map Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which is to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; both the cli@@ cked as well as their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; add all found play@@ lists into your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l section is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under hosts : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User Name : and Password : to enter the data you need for connection to the database .
the tab last@@ .@@ f@@ m al@@ ig@@ ns support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your user name and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send back played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
invo@@ king similar performers : after activation of this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the respective piece . you can view the list in context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them for example to find modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but Flu@@ x@@ box will provide for example difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by logging in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is more sophisticated .
make sure all of them were compiled by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed to be fixed .
this is due to the fact that many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &apos; $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; file doesn &apos;t exist &apos; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( random mode / rer@@ un / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . this allows you to click on a symbol in some cases up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok used the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are solved most easily by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # am@@ aro@@ k channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please only make a mistake if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 X@@ Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select columns . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this works even if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there , just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s the simple : - )
in the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , the button is stored in the playlist . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . see also lib@@ mage , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the actual question must be what media types are supporting G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer even can de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you will use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not included in the default setting ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 c@@ de , input paste
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa heat@@ sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to distribute audio at the same time . this can be achieved by means of a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of your problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
it does &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure you set ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs react to the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . perform the follow @-@ up register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok in advance ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the registry @-@ register again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send them best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . insert an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before going to bed , then you will have wo@@ ken up by the soft tones of the music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to find the current one in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; running titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; window . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button following a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ rich features , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click on the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQL database of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , use files from folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual review has on the overall result .
you can edit the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the Play@@ list window with the right mouse button . then you can change the rating of a piece just as all the other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece , and editing : selecting Edit or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to specify when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Appe@@ al context browser design , click New Design to install ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ;
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install these output modules .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . you must now install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install again .
I am receiving the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how to use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up Am@@ ok Settings ... specify the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 is for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w : 0 } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now insert us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b will take care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual do@@ mix device , des@@ elect the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported any further . of course you can take this issue by yourself ! if you like , you can get the new so much needed car@@ er for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will appear at the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes you search for certain items . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own playlist , you can add it to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please choose action audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD recordings in WAV format . simply drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD here .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make work with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages on a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as every normal multimedia player has also &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a player window with the most important functions . in addition , has &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current part or current stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sample rate of the current play . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red game time to the remaining game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the run@@ time text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be shown in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also found under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q knob is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window is made up of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k playlist is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be shared in two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right @-@ hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current part . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser design . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ window launch is gone . the information shown here is now distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the current piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover artwork of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the play was played for the first time and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to appear in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last part , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the internet .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then saved in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database . to do so , no running text script is required .
the Search button searches for a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First of all the pieces will be arranged by artist , and below will be another division after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under Vari@@ ous interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - sort by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are listed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
there is a search filter directly beneath the tool bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . for instructions on how to use this filter , see the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you have different time frames available , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . besides , you can also select your total collection , whereby the filter is virtually shut off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This le@@ aks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
hang on Play@@ list - Ad@@ ding the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name in which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ding the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this artist / Bur@@ n on CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a composition - Select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
set up a composition selection - Chan@@ ges a record selected as a composition back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the associated artist .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists quite easy . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
also created Intelli@@ gent Play@@ lists are possible . click Intelli@@ gent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used to connect &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to be able to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list artist . when you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , quit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
the tool bar contains a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an input URL . if you enter e.g. tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input paste , you can access music from there into the playlist and drop them .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert slo@@ pp@@ ily files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will only appear . to reset the filter , press the button until the text box is empty .
if you enter search words separated by spaces , search &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment pool .
you can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries will then receive a tag with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button to which you can add items to the playlist . right next to it , you will find play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists , and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , magni@@ fic@@ able analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars there ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for chance mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
a click on this entry opens the Visu@@ alization plu@@ gins window . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by choosing actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to appear in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your large collection in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these will follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on load@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this dynamic playlist .
double click on the desired playlist , drag it to the playlist , or click the right mouse button on you and then select charging . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one .
the two pre @-@ set modes of chance mix and playlist mix instantly fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist will begin with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be de@@ activated .
the New button re @-@ popul@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit play@@ lists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming plays will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed by playing pla@@ ited pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to tick several play@@ lists , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and clicking on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; am@@ aro@@ k scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . once you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Call local scripts .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the to delete script then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .

in this dialog window you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image has been read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / k@@ de@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b website is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you will need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually auto &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality of burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder and En@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Dec@@ oder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 En@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and editing . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , as if you have called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you would have called file clos@@ ets .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to run the medium . burning dialogue can only open if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only blocks the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create an image from a CD which you can then burn at some point later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn at some point later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely er@@ ase the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the pressing button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Content View , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the Content View . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and blocking of the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files to view the project view . the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the view from the other views .
this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ mapping for it further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct authori@@ zations to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for person@@ al@@ ising and fine adjusting the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs will give you preference .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following on the console :
apart from the general &amp; quot ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ cd , format@@ ted DVD , and other functions to generate new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ ri@@ l ( ) void demo@@ .d@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders , and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ select for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many en@@ co@@ ders who en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( comp@@ ressing ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) are supported by default ( These Ko@@ di@@ ver packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if it is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders have to be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the en@@ co@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction about code@@ cs , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ang any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; even do not deal with the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use to read out a &amp; CD will be explained . this will lead ( hopefully ) to understand the stream@@ lined interface of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code@@ c programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , all of which is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder has been configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the option can be read with a different en@@ coder as the default . it is important to note that before the en@@ coder was configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ es ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; ending ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . you &apos;ll need to go here before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ coder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG mag today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , differences are less important as both code@@ ers generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , like standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression ratio approximately 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music from youths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the code generator and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding experts explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button identification in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / input the audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( remark of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively selecting a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , look for source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution must be installed first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
for saving the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the en@@ coder . other codes can be added to this tab itself .
the Ko@@ di@@ zer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . more information about the code can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer .
after installing a coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio code@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine since it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something in with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once , and
the second section describes how to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out@@ going CD .
here we determine the code@@ c to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them on each reading of a &amp; CD ; change if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the output program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . an additional conversion can be defined here . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be notified when information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the CD ; -@@ Settings . just select both entries . we are convenient and allow the &amp; CD ; data will be automatically downloaded from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer via the Internet .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections have to be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number at the same time : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; ej@@ ected after reading the last piece : check this out to disc@@ ard the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / needs to be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wa@@ v files .
just enter it as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again .
in this section it is described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will build and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is set up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD ; .
since we use a CD ; don &apos;t use it in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data fet@@ ched from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD data manually , instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the CD is successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successfully retri@@ eving data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album names , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least at what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re@@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all encoding / file formats . look for help to the Ko@@ di@@ zer to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the released CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not share the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each row of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . simply click on the row to select a piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection of the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the jobs tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right underneath the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message lets you see if you are trying to work with a coder that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . this takes place reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read out and code . in the case of weak machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( from two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ de , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; will enter@@ tain within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the multimedia package . if you are familiar with CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is considered the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; let it do . at least after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you are reading this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to fetch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke live up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is involved as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag a window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
seat support . when you finish playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( on several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , so press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics text and others do both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , which uses a song so that you do not have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also has buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . this can be found in the collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right .
in order to skip a song back , select the button Pre@@ ferred item , the entry Pre@@ ferred item from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always blades a trumpet to play a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except for the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequis@@ ite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , you will specify how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun@@ shot . to do so , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes over 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the supplied Key@@ word@@ press .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped onto the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name Name for this channel will be used . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that receives a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . in the Settings menu , you will find the MIDI Settings menu .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Point channel view : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without being compiled without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
check Automati@@ cally Add to the Collection beforehand . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or tack@@ ed ( when I want to play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , switch the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ .@@ First you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ .@@ Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ V and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this anim@@ ates me to continue programming on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o. Lar@@ ro@@ se@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying Mathemati@@ cs at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not spending much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
you are really looking forward to sending me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no @-@ one gets any money for it . I would like to stress that I can only further programming because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the CI@@ S support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter @-@ Paul Wit@@ ta , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , you can also find on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find there links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is reproduced in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry .
the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / apps folder can also be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , from the View menu and select the next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the same menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; search &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here you can see the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be used to insert the special em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player module must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
so that a given back@@ end is taken for a specific type of mim@@ e ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this needs to be done by changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since V@@ DR can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names are used . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , dv@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source are used . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there any hints on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be performed as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; start files .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the Ki@@ le website should be made .
if you have any questions about or comp@@ iling a box , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and custom @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn its ways the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter work with the Editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , it is also possible to use a lay@@ man ( eng@@ l lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be able to master , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ in@@ r .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ one , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ t &#93; , author &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ t &#93; , film &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Buch ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users now don &apos;t have to worry . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen , it is highly likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is saved by the emphasis on time and anger .
with the automatic completion of the surroundings , entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) is created by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the commands of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( apart is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Files can be helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex . as soon as a DVI , file &#91; data dependent file &#93; &#93; was created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are linked to the editor and as soon as an item was cli@@ cked in the DVI file , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text will jump . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , it will jump to the appropriate place in the DVI file .
master document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
fast Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI , file will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ oked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; after quick build . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , an image , or a different element .
relation : is used for reference to a defined term ( selection over a selection field possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; out by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ s@@ e is used for defining the fon@@ ts . it can be set the fon@@ ts for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . it is possible to specify the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ one contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of a button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically triggers the storage .
if the document fails , the error should be sought after the errors are logged . if you are using Fast@@ ening , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written declaration e 12 is created and only a few acid should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } enables the change of the written spaces inside the environment .
changes are only monitored within the environment ( from \ \ begin } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be itali@@ c represented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } recur@@ sively .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was shown , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a little text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few passages in the grease and cur@@ l pressure and a poem may be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor using editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E ( internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependence ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are needed ( see below ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; - bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern under Settings ... must be set up ... Tools building will be selected .
the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text in order to carry out the search query , and then click on pre @-@ text search . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; -@@ viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ Docum@@ ent the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set up as text editor ( set up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should there be an error when using Quick Construction of the &amp; DVI cable , an error may be present . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file explains the source code of the source code . in the editor , the buttons Pre@@ y La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ t@@ ter La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumping between errors . the logging file always indicates the row in which the error appears . to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or used as an assistant for the quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
common users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex , file must be opened or created to create a new file .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ...
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ one &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used and posters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and empha@@ sizing many different types of text files ( including &amp; de@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters , and to find out more about Kate &apos;s possibilities , the manual is to be used to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le can start working directly with reading the chapter work with the Editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called upon the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with the stu@@ b button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when clicking on the \ \ par by \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip , only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can enter additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit ho@@ ck marks or the corresponding key root enable the jump to the next or last jump stamp . this is also highlighted by this jump stamp , so that at the first input of a sign it is automatically translated .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; plac@@ eable ; already excellent possibilities are added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text always supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
rows a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only beu@@ f thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the sli@@ ts are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Po@@ sters ; offers the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands here for faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to modify the paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edi@@ ting Environment for a possible easy work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the closing bar in the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command em@@ powers the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted welded group clips , the overview can quickly be lost . this command will close the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as a device . for the purpose of execution is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple quotes . also for the ending of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and adds two conclu@@ ding symbols for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there may also be specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available .
for Shift ; Shift key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ Environ@@ ments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ Notes ( amp ; ) among each other . when Dr@@ ying Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the current line .
although &amp; plac@@ ements ; already providing a good source code completion , this was expanded into &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to implement special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic processing . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings ...
at the beginning a new environment is added with the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when you click on the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the complete list changes . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when choosing a command . alternatively , it can be used by &amp; Ki@@ le , so that a jump to these positions is possible with the right @-@ hand snap mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . there may be different lists of lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wi@@ pers of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the complete alter@@ ation mode over the Menu Works , or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key Space , the command to open the environment will automatically be opened and it appears to \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of rever@@ ber@@ ation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations that are immediately replaced with lower strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode over the menu starts the complete reduction or the key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large cups are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many offices are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the settings box ... Ki@@ le relo@@ ad can be switched off . here , the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the compensation .
the missing files can be installed in the Fol@@ der ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home folder . it is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re @-@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups , creating comp@@ iling , converting and creating views .
for the compilation of the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI @-@ file can be viewed in the standard @-@ like viewer by means of Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 ; 4 the DVI ; file to be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command quick build , a viewer is usually called after compilation . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ p@@ lep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar .
API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , we have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; they are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / ly@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible aid provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all files to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and this for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . of &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - working space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , enabling &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be done with installed OS @-@ X .
many thanks to those who strive for the advancement of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use with regard to the &amp; GNU license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors are available in the Help Center &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature will be selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ nature section . signature example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click the Save icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , first select it and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the tool@@ bar .
opens the Sh@@ ort@@ cuts dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the Custom Button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for using &amp; k@@ mail ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call pile elements are listed here . the older the batch entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking on a row of the row in the list shown , the cur@@ sor is placed in the main window to the corresponding line number of the corresponding file .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as base .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the offen@@ ded folder , leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time mein@@ est@@ c is started .
as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the newly opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where the inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file at the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ For@@ med file is , click the well @-@ For@@ med review selection .
for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the place of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme as well as for the Relax@@ NG test is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we begin with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all the plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each and every GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when you add plu@@ gins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
besides the overview of your team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the add@@ res@@ see list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to insert notes is easy . either the comment must be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name is the first name of the Team member , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around par@@ enth@@ eses and tags : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are available via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up by settings of Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with respect to tags , including car completion , can thus be changed . the entries are :
big / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : big / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal bulk / lo@@ wer@@ case , the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags : if checked , will be inserted for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
don &apos;t include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
automatically update start and finish tag : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of various types of files . using the Standard button to recre@@ ate the default settings , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways as with file opening open files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is broken down from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is broken down from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly so that the document can be recovered from this backup when a power failure or crash when the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the PL@@ - and source view in shared mode . see the different modes for see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when editing , and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are group@@ ed into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause ab@@ dic@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
the plu@@ gins can be managed here . plu@@ gins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information will be given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading component in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bu@@ gger has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action triggers the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or it shares the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . includes the link to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sound according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the checked variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution is resum@@ ed . if it is started before a de@@ bu@@ gging request is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to over@@ loaded variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is hal@@ ted , the execution will proceed . if it is given before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where it is corrected in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and how you can help to become better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , capabilities such as car completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes up &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symb@@ ol@@ oriented buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions to insert faster into a document as a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the tag shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than a single element .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only for tag type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
class method only . speci@@ fies the class name where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be blank or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that termin@@ ate a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a broken break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tool@@ box is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; start window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , checking is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a new created &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
a action can be set with settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned key short@@ cut . by clicking on the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . using this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited to ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus tries &amp; qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be inserted to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to the default input . in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
following the input , the output of the executed application can also be rer@@ ou@@ ted . there are two types of output : standard output , written to the standard output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Events .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable &quot; Edit Tag Edit Tag , &quot; if available so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have any difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ cs Other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action is doing , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually seen as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; star@@ t@@ gt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some divi@@ ders in several groups . open the tool bar dialog box settings dialog box settings . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the s@@ na@@ ffle supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by trying all symbols to make sure everything works .
backup in the right folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their tool bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ .2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = func@@ .@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known border for the shaft depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you realize that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of comm@@ a @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places , there is a menu entry with Email , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) sending with email , sending tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scrip@@ ted tree .
resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . in order to make a contribution , we recommend signing the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team as well as for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the Di@@ alogue New resource , the input fields have to be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D @-@ Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definitions line : the string that will appear in the ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it stores all that is selected as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool bars with special actions specially designed for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the project folder , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the tree view , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please consult , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a contex@@ tual menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all tab , relo@@ ading , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to another context menu on the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copying / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags on the mouse cur@@ sor , using the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the character string is a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , such as &amp; lt ; P@@ GT ; then click on the icon representing the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree view ( Q@@ IT ; ) enables you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the display with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like Add , Rem@@ ove , Up@@ load or Del@@ ete the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all options are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project . more on Tem@@ plates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands is opened with regard to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears below the other tree view . with it , attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the application system that is geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project you can add , edit and view project specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two car@@ ers at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all DT@@ D changes are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed specify all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file on your system . therefore auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH before your bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nearby idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ! so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; html ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above requirement must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Develop@@ er community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ knit@@ ted actions , scripts and tool bars automation can increase almost any task . through the program Kom@@ sign you can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . ( find out more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or follow help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest record being taken out .
this allows you to save code portions and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts a special character to &amp; HTML while inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
turn off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching and switching the problem porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries predic@@ ate or next , depending on the cur@@ sor location in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
load the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , managed by the project . see the details in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... are added . tool bars are saved through tool bar tool bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar .
remove a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be re@@ plen@@ ished from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , in the Tags menu , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current Tag settings dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . click on an activated plu@@ gins to de@@ activate it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the plac@@ ard ; -@@ version .
select the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external ti@@ dy .
due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , change can sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the car@@ bure@@ au mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu has an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ ggles status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help in line with the mouse cur@@ sor environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , because , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be termin@@ ated with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file will be filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here is the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and def@@ aults to tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
note if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated . if a project is started anew from scratch , not hooks .
with this option all files and folders will be displayed within the folder and you can make a detailed selection according to your opinion .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the files you want through hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ out of the project .
the latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or shift using the Shift ; F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders available ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files profile window , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing a separate tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ specified event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open .
to open another project , choose Open Project ... from the menu project or the Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the right mouse button @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent removal .
this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk cache option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ load profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply exchange view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do the most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as already mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best stack@@ able through the menu Tool@@ bars . usage and addition differ . adding tool bars is discussed below in the Add of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action , a new tool bar can be created , other actions can be executed like tool bar , ren@@ ame tool@@ bar or create tool bars , which can be displayed , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries are added to the action and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ ters and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have terms for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by linking ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates . for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates . see in for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . some examples are available in template tree under global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . at present there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File as template Save As Local Tem@@ plate ...
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree below project templates .
select text in your document and click File as template save selected as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged using drag and drop to the tree view templates .
creating binary templates is easy : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop , or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link them dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , add files or link them to them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plate template is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / qu@@ anta / PowerPoint templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
in order to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes have been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template library . if a root folder is set so , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be in a root folder .
allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor available through the View menu . the first mode sub@@ stitutes the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to source editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 is activated , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke activ@@ ates the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings Qu@@ anta .... By choice of V@@ PL ; - View can be selected between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small gap for fast machines and a large gap for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the dan@@ ish encoding .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . clicking on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column &apos;s name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typing and er@@ ased via button or distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor day is inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor day needs to be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ ets Wiz@@ ard or Li@@ sts Assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists have to be used tool bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to compile and compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; even libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ G@@ XML , which are present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
stop in a template , at a place in a sty@@ le- or x@@ ml file loaded from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility Mode , orph@@ aned stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without a path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example loading a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , it is checked to a partial or complete agreement with a scale named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a desired stop point must be termin@@ ated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each cycle .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor among the differences windows enables resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files while mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown visi@@ bly . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make it easier by typing just the file name of the first file . example :
trans@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ ders 3 Fol@@ der Fol@@ ders
the Open dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog notices your selection and displays them next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison or merge of folders will be initiated . if for A file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in the open dialog , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste , and compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source pane displays the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white marks are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the file name and &#91; changing &#93; if you have finished the result . usually , it contains text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the button S@@ prin@@ ge to next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is simultaneously a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary row in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also make a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . using the Pa@@ ste button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the composition section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ below / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ top ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Move forward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the cli@@ p@@ board to cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l paste ) . if this is enabled , the option selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful , as you may accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the exit and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 Set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog provides also fon@@ ts with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered straight . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically displays an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab@@ ul@@ ator button is pressed . otherwise a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is then om@@ itted .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 attempts to find all the completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignor@@ es &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return characters are made visible , but as a white character is treated . during the merge this option must be disabled . in default , this is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the automatic skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white notes are less important in many files . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white notes are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and perform mer@@ ging . check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
to change this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is global via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set for each entry separately . if you enable this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
using the selection fields for coding appears a short notice of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
when you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ fabri@@ cation commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ coded over@@ see column . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . make sure you simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison windows next to each other or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first committed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when the line is returned . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your needs . each line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results , but for that an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line termin@@ ations to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now , a pre@@ processing command for line removal is needed , because $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line retri@@ eval . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every mark between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , i.e. quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &quot; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor are retained for the display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm looks like .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 to recur@@ sively compare and merge whole folders .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before startup ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out them ,
... carries selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) or only selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folders , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files listed until then are listed .
when scanning the folders is complete , show &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the join action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed of problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the color red , green , yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes red and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( for example , if A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and if the option is synchron@@ izing directories . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical afterwards . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge selected ( unsure ) is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date , an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is processed after another . the status column shows skill when mer@@ ging was successful , and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if a full @-@ time analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge either the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected any mer@@ ging actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode C is used as destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is chosen as destination and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the folder structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to just merge the current entry , select the current element &apos;s action , or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the faulty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Options , Cre@@ ating , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you only want to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message will appear and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge again later . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the Element@@ um . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e. g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
for links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checking for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default .
results in a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed either . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not just the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the Fol@@ der View menu remains visible during the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the Fol@@ der &amp; Text windows to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window .
you can also directly merge a file from the merge menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . to do so , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be placed on registration and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slave . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Trust of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a Differ@@ ence Viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first starts with the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my say thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or let him go that way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure inst@@ alls in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the case .
the editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information .
the effort has so far been too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor needs to be used .
after removing text suddenly appears ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information about how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
for a list of recent changes , see ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have problems with compile . if you still encounter difficulties , please report to the e @-@ mail list .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) Cop@@ ies to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you have to re @-@ read the folder with the update function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder while mer@@ ging . if the target folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C source below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button respectively .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , stop them or post@@ p@@ one them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running therein . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other work@@ spaces .
the contex@@ tual menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and name of the application as well as the entries will minimize , maximize , apply to desktop and finish . the commands will do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces .
when this field is enabled , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; indicate the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is enabled , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use with &amp; K@@ ish ; enlarge a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photograph . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; launch , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is referred to as magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below .
as an alternative , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor being displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the selection screen mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ b ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays solid and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops updating the display . stopping the update causes the CPU time needed to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( very low , low , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; Automati@@ cally uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , relo@@ ad ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; is a magni@@ fier . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a screen area , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research engineer or artist to web designer or visual impairment .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is on the same spot for a while . it is thought to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause pain to every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is on the same spot for a while . it is thought to help people suffering from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief items , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and results in a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
if the smart push is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent push requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; mouse click .
if Intelli@@ gent Move is enabled , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through the mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click .
when the sound appears delay , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slide control sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window surrounds please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of Apply .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should be switched off . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart push .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first of all , you should be aware in which places a mou@@ sec@@ lick remains un@@ affected : clicking on the neutral component of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not result in unwanted reactions .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse sphere , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
at first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe off with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click itself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the mouse on where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . this way , accidental mouse clicks may cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines from windows .
I try to work with intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart push is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very possible to mark text , copy it to cli@@ p@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart push when you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mou@@ sec@@ lick at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . as a result , each time a mouse click is played , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shooting period starts . later , you can use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . but for that it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you must install the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and it is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the mo@@ ths .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; it can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets silent users talk to their computers for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the Setup dialog .
on the second page , you can choose the standard text@@ book dictionary . you can often choose text passages from the text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary for the words supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have set correctly , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , you specify the character encoding which will be passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ em@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a passage in the menu Text@@ pass or in the Lei@@ ste for Text@@ passages .
the selected text passage is first entered into the input field with the selection of instant references . the selected text passage is first entered into the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box closing the processing window for Text@@ pass &apos;s book , you can specify whether the passage book should be saved automatically when closing the processing window .
when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book book is not saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text directory is to be saved .
the dictionary page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary on the word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the drop @-@ down field the language for the dictionary .
select the language required for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the assignment . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main part of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structures .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages and text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the sequ@@ encer .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the sequ@@ encer .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected phrases of the sequ@@ encer .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default via the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with hints of the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output correctly or not fully . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice menu language edition . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . )
festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ k@@ ish are supported . the license allows to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and dis@@ semin@@ ate it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ esp@@ . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax happily swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in &amp; k@@ mouth &apos;s settings dialog ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can be issued text by the computer . it stores a list of already sung phrases , which the user can always re @-@ spend again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer is included . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the speech synthesis program .
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the tab card is displayed .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
several speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer lines for the same printer .
if you click on the map leader in kt@@ m@@ gr , the card card will be displayed . it will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speaker appears on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the speaker menu . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map instructions to create and manage text orders .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the &quot; General tab &quot; tab to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the kt@@ ts ; this will start the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this startup is successful , the map will be shown and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the Mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it is running &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and t@@ t@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the control bar when reading it , it disappears once the reading has been completed .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , ab@@ ort , pause , and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab in the General and check the Voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . first check the text that should be read before , and select the Text to read text in the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; html ; -@@ pre @-@ suspen@@ sions and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Plac@@ ing ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the displayed text first . then check the text that should be read before , and select the Text to read text in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ ep@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fying you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversion ; for example , set up a message in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the Tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be accepted in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech dis@@ semin@@ ators &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguish four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is too hot . a warning takes preced@@ ence and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you initiate from the map is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are thought for the edition of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are executed in queue , except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this output is hal@@ ted and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
text strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string substitute filters , which facilitate the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting news from &amp; conc@@ iling ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ml .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the Spo@@ kes@@ person Spe@@ aker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the filter type , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for the setup of character ch@@ ain@@ ing filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the respective replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ bet column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter Cop@@ ete .
the text string release filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if they agree . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character ch@@ ain@@ ing filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual , you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs add or edit as help to connect these expressions ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PA@@ TH , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the voice selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the menu speaker , or to a speaker with certain characteristics . you can , for example , define that texts of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; send a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker characteristics , which sends the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card card Spe@@ aker . with the voice selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to receive help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialogue box selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the voice selection filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that you can use this synthes@@ izer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; you will find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bilit@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice recognition services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and an option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type :
open two &amp; kon@@ sole ; window . just start t@@ t@@ d in a window , then t@@ t@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my speech . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to make S@@ able work at all . you must also do it yourself if you do not use this voice to read websites . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found through the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing cat@@ fish is issued . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option code @-@ code option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string release filter .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own licence , which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a separate license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code below ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ z@@ an .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . so check the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the kt@@ ts website ; for information that is not yet included in this manual .
the speech synthes@@ izer program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand using another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ml and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for trans@@ missions or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use Desktop , check whether speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech synthesis program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech disp@@ at@@ chers is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text will be divided into separate sentences . the user can go back set or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be automatically chosen the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker choosing , you will see in .
if you click Add to add a speaker to the list , and so that a speaker is inserted in the list , or click Edit , the panel display will be displayed . as an example , the unit of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in case of voices that are &amp; kt@@ ts ; this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sli@@ ders adjust the volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and this grey is displayed , the chosen voice will not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is more quickly synthes@@ ized ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed kt@@ m@@ gr in the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and dict@@ at@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all jobs in the queue are listed , along with the application setting the job , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card card spokesman .
with the buttons in this series , you can pre @-@ select or return to the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
clicking OK will make all changes to the settings ( also on the other index cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are performed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about twice the normal speech speed . in order for these adjustments to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are installed in your system . most of them will not work . you will have to find out which device works for you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the orders received are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you let &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , the audio output will be added to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the incoming message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts , read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , run kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the tab al@@ erts appear .
check this check box to enable reading &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are written by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message sending &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are written by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the list of the speaker as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do so , you can set the default notification as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ml ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . furthermore , brands for controlling pron@@ unci@@ ation , for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ml is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ml only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the issue of SS@@ ml .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ml text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! Doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / / ww@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech / speech / speech / speech synthesis &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , S@@ B@@ Ds can begin to sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . thus , you can skip or stop or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this .
here you see the set limit recognition filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as default . you can change its settings or add other set limits filtering filters , but beginnings will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn pron@@ unci@@ ation is to try out the speaker selection and select text to read . check on the card selection , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts ; select , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this feature .
for these reasons , the regular set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
comment Fil@@ ters match text with a regular expression for pun@@ ish@@ ers and insert a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set boundaries ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ night ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute detection filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file .
the Car@@ ter Card Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection allows you to over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set @-@ up properties .
select the method to enter desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
check this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also place multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a specific application sends text in a different language than the default in the working environment .
to use all the characteristics of the speaker , which is most likely to be deleted , click on the standard speaker select and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , you may need to install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output about AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . when I get a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; ein . on the Con@@ sole ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflicts arise with AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed them and can use them in Festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not display this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ s.@@ com@@ . If this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice , send to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PA@@ TH . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the cartridge card . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ml . ) de@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ by @-@ SS@@ ml converter filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t make it happen that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival spokesperson , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER doesn &apos;t seem to work . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file th@@ rows the x@@ s@@ l file to convert from SS@@ ml to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a custom ch@@ ain@@ ring release filter and now I can go in &amp; Desktop ; no more stat@@ ely default or return . on the Purch@@ ase Or@@ ders it is shown , the order consists of only one set . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional symbols instead .

some users experience conflict with AL@@ SA during audio output . if your system also counts , you can not simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze when you start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .

before you use it , check first whether your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you want to read websites read , you must install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software to festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to input the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) code such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this phone . festival generates this from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of error correc@@ tions is not required , you just need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings across a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection of K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; Start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf to display the device at all and enable the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the network settings option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and release date . by checking the setting of non @-@ return requests , the option can be hit dur@@ ably .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you enter system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Administration Mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode , all module functionality is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network Interface &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network Interface &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to be set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Exten@@ ded Settings button shows the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are retri@@ eved from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
the choice of manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address you need to specify the desired TCP / IP address . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface at boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole , you can see if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . turn on an off @-@ off network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or disabled according to your needs . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the Interface ...
defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name given by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers are only able to understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator is a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in priority by selecting a entry and add @-@ on or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons down or down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . you will see the Edit Pan@@ e dialog .
the name @-@ known host tells host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily at boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of Nam@@ ed hosts contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in test version of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known host has multiple alias names , click the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog friends will edit the machine will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf will be discussed ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; work place , the network administrator is the contact point that a valid IP address is filed or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the default route is required for IP transmission .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is dropped by the scrip@@ ting in Su@@ SE@@ config . another state than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; dat , re@@ juven@@ ate the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognize &amp; dat ; do not recognise the preview on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; dat ; the preview , it searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by un@@ folding the entry .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; dat ; it requires that a tape before being used must be format@@ ted . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape away . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be saved .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the check@@ out has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re @-@ establish the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the record for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can re@@ create the index in two ways from the tape :
this creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files located in the same fil@@ esystem are backed up like the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry will be viewed by tar independently of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then will be backed up .
the name of the file that has been used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
if this setting is active , tran@@ sm@@ its &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; ch@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting doesn &apos;t work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , it will be automatically ej@@ ected when releasing the device . do not use this option on flo@@ ppy drives .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; ch@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate the block size for your tape drive in any case .
if &amp; dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n te ) The tape ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , whereby the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be directly administr@@ ated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . moreover , experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems occurring on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter out a string in the filter bar . the list of the protocol lines will now be changed automatically so that only the protocol lines will be displayed , which will be displayed to the selected filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be shown if the string of filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , then show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than protocol lines of the step hint . the color representation of protocol lines can be turned in setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add to new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the main window context menu to show all new lines added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows viewing multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu pane to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log message in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archiv
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather familiar ( and named as renamed ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not address historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not among / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start when starting the system or switching to another running level . system services do not include such things as Network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port when you boot .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one he finds .
the default running level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have mess@@ ed up on the in@@ it@@ tab file . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then get it re@@ started by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no real files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called start with the argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; b ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ ning level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area . in order to only copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , running level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another running level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ways , and now the machine is constantly re@@ starting . what can I do ?
type in the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; running under Run@@ Level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check that all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , it may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this guide can be attached to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save to the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . it will display the user and group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space constraints ( quota ) for users will create a card that allows you to customize individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD &apos;s Unix .
the card password management tab appears if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed like in BSD _ Uni@@ xes .
this map only appears , if at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations of each file in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with wild@@ ly limitation .
the Groups Map groups provide information on the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the standard group , which the user owns , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user resp@@ . the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO System Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change , change , change , and more .
