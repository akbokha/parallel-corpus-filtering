<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the point of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, Babelfish produces a rough translation and, in the worst case, nonsense. therefore, translations should not make important decisions depending on the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated into the Internet. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish website by yourself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the map tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the box kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on Tools File. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; crashed, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View filter module (also called Folder Filters) is available in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filter. with the module you can filter the current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; choose Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, sample: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the lower objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be considered a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap account is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles feature meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can display either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the image of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby therefore display errors can occur by constraints on the mark of the Treemap). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps in Treemap, the rule should be observed that the area is proportionate to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected. it will draw the frame to display the nesting of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is possible for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through the frame to divide the rectangles which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can designate the minimally represented area for an entry on the menu entry View. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the associated entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the" "" "Photo Gallery" "" "can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras photo gallery... or with Ctrl; I." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "the option" "" "Images" "" "per line has a slider and a field to set the number of miniatures of each line in the gallery." ""</seg>

<seg id="32">With the subfolder check box, you can set a slider to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can copy the original pictures to the gallery using the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can set a different colour depth for the thumbnail pictures than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings offers easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media playback for the navigation area in the & konqueror; Display menu in the navigation pane, or using the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation range of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; on which you can change browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the code in MSIE for pages rejecting access to browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the function of this deprecated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & digih; -albums can be downloaded. of course, every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digiously; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; tries to make reporting problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides an entry problems or requests reports.... This opens a dialog with an underlined shortcut. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. all required information is already entered here. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicam; is a project that is supported by a community. that means that the user and developer are helping each other. if you are a regular user of & digicam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions other users of & digicam. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digicam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digiarrived;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digicode; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter here a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data will be saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; will you additionally use as an AlbenLibrary. settings digicode set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as base folder. & digicode; view each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during browsing the folders you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; searches recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this can be done by inserting one point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digicode your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keyword List to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, digicam can be digitised; it may also handle it. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decodersettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect with your digital camera and your photos can be downloaded directly in & digih; -albums can be downloaded. of course, every medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact and Flash; Memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; used the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of the images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails from digicam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be seen or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about digicam: how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier to digicode; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes were in & digicam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping images works everywhere: you can put an image in a different part of the alb tree, above the horizontal partition or another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently being displayed in the icon view. so filtering on the file name will only work if it is shown in the symbol view. which fields will be displayed in the dialog box settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlist quot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digicam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the alben characteristics or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Import screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection. to access the album features, right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos when you choose collection from the toolbar or sort out albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons elder, average, new: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do so, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digiy; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlibridge quot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu. additionally, you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; support the input of key words for individual photos in the My Keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while the thumbnails will be generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each picture is displayed below the appropriate preview. what information this is can be edited by editing; set up the albums page and customize the preview pictures to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all tags of a picture. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digicam; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements. you can select all the functions that come with & digicode. you have the choice between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or selecting the right mouse button or the right-click context menu. in the editing section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digicam; the functionality that you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the contextual menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. to do this, and how to adjust them to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after working with other image editing programs, it can cause problems with the metadata in the picture. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way to right-click on the preview and to select rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you will retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digih; delete it, it will be moved into the trash bin by & kde; F8 Picture Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& digicam; use either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by choosing this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by doing so you can organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My Keywords column; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords are re-imported when & digicam is lost; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or on an existing keyword, and then choose New Keyword. if you have a new keyword, after you click on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the option to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My stitch quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select a different photo as an album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos that you want to add with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My stitch & quot;. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of tags. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords associated with it. in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keywords, this will appear below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select removing from the menu-menu. the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows an adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved by this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection, which appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Nebraser search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in the My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit an advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The Tools for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "if you want to delete an existing search from the list, select" "" "Clear" "" "in the context menu." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digivar; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. one option can be added to this list with search group / deleted or deleted from it. each option can be associated with other via the logical operations of all..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can let each picture fall to find a similar. by means of a sill, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-on sketch: draw a quick sketch and digicode; find the right pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Marble thumbnail. you can zoom in or zoom in or hold it and move it. move it while you press the left mouse button. move it while you press the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this is then added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofix.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that lets you easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Create the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window open. once you are in & digicam; main windows are, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview toolbar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronize preview from the toolbar and execute Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then they are also executed with the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture sequence. if you use pairing mode from the tool bar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison. now use the left mouse button on any preview screen to display it in the right-hand side. this simplifies it through a series of similar pictures to work through.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB; in the preview, then both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom function works just like in other views. just use the zoom regulator in the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, archiving, optimizing, plotting, archiving, optimizing, waiting and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confers and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">Dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you will need to find a certain photo without continuance management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digicode;. the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if other access to your photos should be whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive, etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location. the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes pile handling easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata to be saved in & digicode settings in the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? for this, digicam provides them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign words, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start the best with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now use keywords, keywords, as you often do in other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded key words, then & digicam; automatically set the tree for you or paste the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very crude representation since each block of metadata consists of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let anybody see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motive that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with an inscription for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet before GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to make use of geolocation are countless and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips with Google Earth using images. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and denotes the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digicam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">This field contains the name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a memo to the author's field, this must also be filled in.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they offer no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify this, in the image embedded metadata. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digicam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, dissemination</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which cause data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, those cautious ones need to be handled and you may not be trusted for longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to errors even if they have just been written. that is why they use a control humming mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control hammers. despite this massive protection, they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that appears to cause miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disc can store 50GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is also true for the Blu-ray Disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. then read the media again to check for you. likewise, you should copy the media with a description, date & author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the defects identified by SMART tell the imminent failure. this is especially reading errors and swap counters. the expected lifetime value is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the total loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not matter much, it looks different with computer chips and high-speed sensor devices. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious damage. so protect yourself from the unavoidable result that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip. remember that not each connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it offers protection against flash handling and protects properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system can also be protected. some manufacturers produce overvoltage protectors, which also have a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the television adapter.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an interruption-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current runs. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than and euro; at the end, you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow for this.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr more. for $25 per year, you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of data protection. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the big companies contain a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all of these disorders remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. nobody seems ever to have thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data pathway than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they create interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started his own initiative with his btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel yet.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the loss of data on the notebook and 46% on workstation systems. notebooks are already the share of thefts 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lesser damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. meaning that while technology is further developed there is a natural limit to this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, secure your data after a plan and test this backup before you make anything more dangerous than reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into the neighbouring house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the one-to-one backup and the last difference lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike Script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, maintaining memory, scalability, media, rediscovery of images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time flies. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. remain with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and placed the area you want to increase to a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk was recognized by the system, but do not hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBgt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier every year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16 bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment in heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages pictures in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the video formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and commits to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP is for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original image, mostly in raw format. XMP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems with the connection between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of mission and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds, and informative efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with digicode; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; in the section Add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn on it. for more information, see the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. for some cameras it can take a while. some cameras do not display preview images. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for your application will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information on each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that are internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as with the metadata page strip from the main window of & digicam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button to download and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from your camera in a single album in & digicam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend checking if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. download Selected until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not been digitised until now; in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download or download the selected albums, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos will be stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums chapter. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them by clicking the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, then you have to select them first and use Delete Selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded in a & digih; album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera file, you should do so via the camera menu as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to include in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Auto Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the Prefix photo-% Y% H:% M:% M:% M:% M in the editing field. turn on the Date & Time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in capital letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which is digiously; for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digicam; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Enhanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date at which the photo was made, & digicam; use this to automatically create sub albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta section, you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in that case & digicam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced Button and select the option date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer on your camera is the button download. select uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digicode; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the pictures will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users want to locate the location of the photos, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle strings and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DCS Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other dates, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign posted coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">Digicam; tries to give you so much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digih. to access these settings, you need to change the settings in the Settings menu. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be displayed on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digicode; fixed, if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should be the professional title of the photographer. this can be designations such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name of the photo. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations should be listed here as this is the picture to others & quot;.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digicam; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & digicam; without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image descriptions can be saved as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that will appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole picture size, you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark and bright color in the image. these colors are set here. in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it means that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF imagery. this reduces the size of the TIFF image. it does not affect the image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-loss setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digicam, editing was just a picture viewer for photos. at present, it is very fast developing into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option marks the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a passing white. use the setting to trigger some unusual results, as it shows the top lights in various Rosatönen. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast filling as green and red. and dcraw are therefore trying to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the yet unfilled blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the reconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done in the image options of the digicam; image processing. to keep the time for the voicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-invoicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and that a matrix of colored pixels is available. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw provide three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis-Directed) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for correcting the color, since it is performed during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions such as these should be returned. there is also LCMS and & digicam; information like the color information from a color space to translate into the others so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Provide here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you store all your profiles. & digicam; examine this folder then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for storing your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color administers not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include hue mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile you can emulate on how to print your picture from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with Canon's models. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you see the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digicam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these are then edited by & digicode; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">Slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes activate the metadata that are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features appear on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right hand side there is a button auto detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / version, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digicam; the camera automatically recognises. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can view the conversation of & digicam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly controlled by & digicam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without reviewing. otherwise, you must save the changes using the button 'Changes' button.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digicode the display of the greeting image; this speeds up & digiplug the start process under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Setting Start after new photos is forcing & digging; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digicam; if something was deleted from the base folder, & digicam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digicam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar's preferences panel. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicam; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view and review your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of previewing and selecting the entry / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicam; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the tool bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before you have used the Save file or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you did not save the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the button The button Recover the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have taken in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action in the image processing can be undone or restored. undo the last action by selecting Edit undo / restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should remember the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and memorize Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; via the undo or restore button in the toolbar a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture down, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the viewing menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you get to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can also change the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can call it in the Edit & digicode Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. entire picture preview pages can be selected from your selection. you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select from the menu Album Exports Print Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digicam; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigation file, also available in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear and disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC description field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or just switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the Apply button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keywords used in this & digital session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The Keyword Tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword in the search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering the keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are saved to the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a sample with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword trap filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their album, - date, keyword and search views is used. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard tags. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection. then a dialog asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is written on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree is drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off in settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and have created and determine that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and the rule range.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digicam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-administered workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner that have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scanned colors. with a color-administered workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme is on color management, everyone would like to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture expenses are by email or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB is working so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why use a different color space and thus have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB animation compared to the colours we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to calibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you must calibrate your monitor, since sRGB runs on your monitor. when you work as a color space of sRGB, you must either calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting more manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, adjust, Automatic comparing and contrast extend from the menu Corrective Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the luminous values over the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot becomes as brighter as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method uses the luminous reactor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the same results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-jisting of all values in between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance from & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited since you work over a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can move too far from the original image areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original image again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram shows that dynamic is changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result shown in white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button returns all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for processing raw images. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. color tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can be consulted in the Color Manager chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find in the menu under color tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same error and therefore you always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digicam; tool colour effects provide four colour effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by exposing a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completing the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negativity of the picture. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity is controlled by the ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. further upliftment ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the intensity applied is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and with it a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of your photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under color. all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview. once you are happy with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on sound correction to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the application purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph are three slides into which can be clicked and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the knob and watch how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box you can set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gammages.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweets can be used to preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow selecting manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can, for example, be used to create a bleached image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and reloaded later. to do so, the Gimp levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input will be automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the results of the red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator lets you check all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photograph. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left-hand side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified Channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curvature to the right, e.g. the bright sounds, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see. if you shift this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is shown on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can make exactly this. every curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp Curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade, medium and suntan. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color nuances of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the tones of the images. you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first reference how to correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and output. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep luminance the image will retain the general brightness even if you also activate the corresponding color components. this is particularly convenient if you also use the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the eyebrow. colour brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns in each channel look different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. you can store any blender settings for later and then load them. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator lets you check all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance flag is activated. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, since color pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this enhances landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate phases of the moon at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepitheliaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a little coldness in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and the re-development in a sepideroner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokine (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digixing tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper of textuality has been applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the changed one (2) to see. the relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you will set the desired frame type for your image. throughout the picture with a colored line, Niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), edged it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool according to the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template apply you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digicam; mail list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob magnifies the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resets the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you have to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it does here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process paints with only minimal differences to a color point. elements that are smaller than the resolution thus are combined to a common color. this in turn results in sharp edges to be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for home users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often used in internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a field filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you get control over your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening keying keg. you can use the menu entry for more corrective sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should carefully circumvent this because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique to focus an image will refocus the tool. you can achieve it via the menu entry Correction. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for the softer sign with the menu item Correcant softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool for removing veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and impression of grates will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount applied. this allows a minimum difference to be defined for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digicam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted removal filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixels. in most cases, the FIR Vienna inverse of the Gauss's folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels, causing unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most images the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a good value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss' sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's edge. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocusing parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filters. practically the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English below this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob alters the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention to detail p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values are mainly smoothing areas and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should preserve detail in such a way that no sharpening should be necessary retrospectively.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional Addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value suggests 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing over all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm goes through. usually, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-width since [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with small artifacts are corrected. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there's a strange black artifact in the background that caused by poor film shift during the journey.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter needs per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel space that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all the noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also brightens the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjusting of the phase damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use the tool for softening with the menu item Correcant softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG compression: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artaktequot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Load render exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo with uniform roughness is restored.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera was recorded on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicam; tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Light, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially with high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and "quot; light pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate darkpicture to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. notice that the wizard shows the last dark image and reloads it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then choose the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn up for the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn up to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the Vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, they & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise uneven effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure range of today's films and the color and grey level of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that was done without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which results in an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly of a light intensity of 2, reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a better readjustment of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting Correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree coefficient treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The fourth grade coefficient corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the intensity of distortion second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the fourth degree of distortion. this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters have the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positively shrinking the image.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness to the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog provides a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnt- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect is evidently the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu transformation Cutting out of the image processing or using the Zoom slider to remove this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, e.g. shots of front, frame and paintings, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction on a church in Norway. the original image can be seen at (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 infrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to simulate film granularization and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add Film Grant if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel it makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film baskets on your images. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the movies, the makers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film distribution effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film distribution effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the applied film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digicam; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes lend themselves better for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and smoothes 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients change slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraver defines your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraver is a quick tool to give your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows setting the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art with blurring effects. it uses copyright-protected algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Blurring: blurred the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photograph in rectangular cells and then create it by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the digicam; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it in the right direction by mirrors or turning. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers Rotate or Transformers mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you retrieve the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm which is used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. to do this, change ize size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approach the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each insertion for photo zoom can be saved as text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast at what it does, but it can take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the doubled size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. to cut a photo you simply have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save to the File menu to save the newly-edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater height of the height and the transverse format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Trimming the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches, or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coaster aid allow you to show help so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the smelly sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The gold pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden divide at all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean. a composition that follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides fluid relief lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will help you achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a smooth line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangle of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangle is used to create the golden spiral. it should give something to the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can simply be there without directing the eye, it will fulfill its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also diverge from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to place these lines can be a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Options mirror and mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">The Color button lets you set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it is easy that you do not hold the camera horizontally or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image processing and tool-free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the presets button, you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the transformation function transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically ZuCut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after rotation. but keep in mind the warning above.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a little blurred. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate twice the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not rotation, the picture is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module over transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two insulations generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the image has unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicam; shows only files in formats that you know. this is done on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of them with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can change the file in the image processing. you can change this list of file extensions and change them. in the configuration section, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digicam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes on digital images. redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the shell format, please read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw-format images in JPEG or TIFF with the Digital Image Converter by & digiplug; in the configuration section you will find further information about the use of modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softlock, noise reduction, refocus, unsharp masks, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image.</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal splitting without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing and graphviz; -dot; -graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; programs that include & graphviz; programs with just a few functions according to the program author.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraph viewer; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& clowviewer; is a KDE program for viewing and graphviz; -dot; -graph. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kimaviz; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Pointer; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graphene in & posters; the graphene is calculated and in & kgraphs interviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or graph in & kgraphs; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graph (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphs viewer; is a & kde; program which assumes the & graph; -Tool & dot; for representing the graph. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & clowviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list contains last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded in & kgraphs viewer; uploaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kimaviewer; can also note your decision so that later as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraphs viewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & cviewer; instance open, & eg; in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & cviewer; instance or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a sub-window of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog later.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the sections of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one graphene distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The page Renewal Load gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page opening gives the possibility to define the behavior of & kgraphs; you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of & kgraphs viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the last session files) or decide to be asked at each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at one click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graph viz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge-overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungenerated graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the jump-spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a spring-spring model for ungerified graphene. it uses the Fructman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multiple grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graph.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm prescribes the knot circularly according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multi-cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for each type (dot; for directed, & neato; for uncoated graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module includes tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears where you can replace the default values ducrhe's own to select your image. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button Scan to read the image. the estimated file size is displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button Scannen, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore produces very large files. you also need to select the folder and # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected in the import &gt; screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select The complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the complete Desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI Calendar Calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management system. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Flickr module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. thus, it is virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented to you following a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog showing the current access permissions the module displays. to upload, you will need write authorizations. the module currently does not support any other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Pictures should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click the Ok button to start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the picture as key words during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillia you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinates system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localisation correlative. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-to-see dialog appears. to be able to load a possible correlation between time and location, you must load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were recorded at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera system must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera pair. if the deviation below the data is merged, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from one place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have matching data. if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set with this dialog manually. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog changes the coordinates of a call to the next, you just have to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region in question and enlarge it again and again until you have reached sufficient accuracy. the map can always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into an image gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 in order to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The panel has four tabs in which the settings can be selected. the selection allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the alben preview and the text displayed in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">This tab is largely self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will appear in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport containing everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth, which of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The horseman thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the messages to see if errors have occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooms or slips on them. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. he has been developed for quick image display and quick access to his functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture will be shown in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size is increasing as there is no compression of the color information. for example, this can be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module Digital Camera Klient currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied to which you have pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, with a defined length. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module through Extras MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you have to select the corresponding PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the rate of the image transition is set below. a low value creates very sudden, high contrast very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the created file using the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie using the button code. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that codes or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software by your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG Switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion score. the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use JPEG format, you should not use JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that are included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using the button Add images. a preview is shown on the right-hand side for the last selected image.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the image list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">To remove pictures, remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all images, click the OK button to open the new message window of your email client. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you select have already been added as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used again every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format Menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages, in the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. with the button closing, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option will show that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option allows the presentation to be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to randomly select images ensures that the images are displayed in random order. so it is not used to order the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, any transition between the pictures chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and start the presentation, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background screen is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have your pictures and videos with comments, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with comments. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed. by using this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save his own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to set yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you will need to view the image-view window (described in more detail) and in the context menu, you can select the image for the respective person. in the viewing window you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter searches in the main window, you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can see this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, images where Jesper but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but want to try something like this, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & photoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar shows you here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see part of a database by displaying 10 minute sections only.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview button) and also the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate to the preview screen.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time frame in the preview screen. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page. read more about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can choose which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are of a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page, you can set different resolutions for the images. this means those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images that have a resolution of 1600x1200 for example.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will launch in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so the import function, see, works correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these settings, a subfolder will be created, whose name will be set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have spent a lot of time collecting the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to work with & kphotoalbum; this work will not be done again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kin file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ if the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can pass on so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you created when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file by means of HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images, which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy the manual to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">Copying the Automatically to the .kim file location copy & photoalbum; the images will automatically be for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import..., & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders to copy the images you want to import.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of imported file should be imported, and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) Specifying information about your images, about (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been extended and now your videos are taking care of. in many places in this manual we talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the index.xml file in the top of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and automatically reuse them in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry preferences kphotoalbum; set up... get to a window that lets you change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will be able to explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described in detail how to define different properties for each image, for example people, places and tags. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, subcategories were already mentioned. in the Dialogue Options, you can set up complete members groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a middle member as explained in the section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right one list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; share his module system with other graphic applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. more detailed information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed through the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other, it may be that the modules were tested with the demo database before using them on your own images. you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help Menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage of sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order after albums for some modules to make use of the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser indicates the content of a category, for example all persons, each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or there will be the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, you will do it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the module to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you and photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top of the toolbar. under the toolbar you can see the window to search for your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the item shown to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to note each picture with notes. this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture, where the image has been recorded, etc. you can either set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you like, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by using people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can so that the names used are moved up to find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with comments. in this case, simply click the front and back buttons, which are located below the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item more entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is an over-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new heading or sub-category. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window by dragging it out of the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click on the Options... button that offers among other things the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely out. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and here you can hide / hide windows. see this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select images in your browser, you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images in case you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply pulling down the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the images you want to delete and press the Delete key or select Edit Selection from the Edit menu. now, the window will appear to you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use it with & kphotoalbum; you can also use the images somewhere, so that you can record it in the database index. in the picture you will see the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper edge is truncated are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders and copy them back. so if you want to avoid trouble, how to avoid clinging your pictures, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the File menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images so that in the end those who wish to make you inaccessible and click on the current view bar in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also opt out all the images that your little sister may see, and choose the menu item Clear All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you are now giving your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item to block images, so that all the images you have locked can be hidden. if you want to get the pictures shown again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password to be entered for unlocking the images. to set up this password, simply change your password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to deny the view on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have about the image, such as who is in the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image and image below. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; loads a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus respectively minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can enter in the image and zoom out. with the mouse button you can simply pull out a rectangle. with the Minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zooms into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the power button, the zoom uses the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">The screencast functions from the context menu can make you rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can cancel the view and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to select the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">The two examples above give the viewer the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in that you press the corresponding letter. in this picture you see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so if you have all the images that you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add them all at once with comments. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window. if you can view categories in the Preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see it here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to mark the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovray; you need to master the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you necessarily have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodel views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the location where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to make these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will appear with an error description. then, you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; -User Documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a lower part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the predictability level of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different directions.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the passer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to order multiple views over one another, drag the passer into the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map guide at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the passer to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfering bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with window rules... save. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Renders icon The icon Renders in the toolbar or select the menu entry View Scene Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">Render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or choose Render Modi menu in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to indicate the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size chart, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual on & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">These images often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">What is the difference between abs (r 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn it on, change & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Open a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; Scene, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can include source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version here. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data files) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The colour for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values will result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you want to dial high attention to detail for advanced projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of the perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you want to display a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you want to display the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the channel smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. in the Render-Modi section, you can set the parameters for depth and threshold.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window arrangements. in the section of window orders, it explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector default window arrangement: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Existing window rules list shows all existing window arrangements. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and remove a selected order with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the button Add and Delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten to anchor the window under the existing window, with a card card you get a map view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you will only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't want to insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultlessly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window rules:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tools of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and icons and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but be aware that the camera has control points that you can change to the camera's target point. simply click with the left mouse button to a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a fader (insert end body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: choose the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view also shows the level, even if at the moment it is only a limited finite level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you view the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">The pigments will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property tab (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the button Preview you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material, because you need to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many options again, but now take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on a rectangle and a sphere in preview, just click the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called single-color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkerboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Each time you choose one color in the object tree, change the colors in the properties pane:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already do this step as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler. the ball is just as easy to create as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or button Apply), so that the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the bottom to one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now gives a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matted black material. in the next step, set up a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">When you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Unicolored and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection effects already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces even when Metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler provides. hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer reverses hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have effects.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have created with & kpovmodeler before.</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Once you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. you can only select this menu item if you have used Edit Uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodelers; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to set default short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodelers using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump mapping is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to render the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can view with click the & LMBn; or the return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or if all images will always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. when a matching filename is found, the file will be highlighted. you can exit the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as & amarok; short commands work. thus, you make your keyboard to the & amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripting.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use kDialog, so the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kDialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easy. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to view the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is launched, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is accumulated. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece could be retrieved (for example, the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Bike contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also given for the script to use dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleaning operations. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script parcels with the catchy caterscript. for this reason, you should appoint your script parcels properly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script needs to be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and link to the wiki scripts page of & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're looking for a very specific title for thousands in your collection. with & amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can't decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right one for you. and if you still find it hard to decide, dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how you want to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok from the base folder of the Amarok sources:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated with the configure script at compile time. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options certain dependencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used. for details, see the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activate debugging icons. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& amarok; set up without effort into the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition, if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option switches on the experimental function of the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Design more atmospheric: this function is only available if & amarok; compiled with support for the mood barometer. this changes the color scheme used for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Save voice files from the music files: this feature is only available if & amarok; when this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files. otherwise, the .mood files are stored in the preferences folder of & amarok; stored (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you want to save playlist by beaming, the current playlist will automatically save when you exit & amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible while changing the piece, that the playlists window open / roll in order to keep the current piece always in the visible area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context-browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of various fonts in & amarok. by selecting own fonts, the otherwise gray shown section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlists window, player window and context browser. click Select... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Selecting Custom color scheme gives you the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme. for this purpose, use the color selector activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume play at startup causes that & amarok; after program start, resume playback automatically with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last exit.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Set up the subwindow On-Screen-Display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is attached, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors do not use, the pre-set & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field introduces the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can decide on which screen of a multi-screen environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output card output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down selector. some drivers will enable even more adjustment options in this flashcard.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The FileMap Collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which is to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes that & amarok; both the clicked as well as their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted), and incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & amarok; add all found playlists into your collection folders (.pls and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down selector: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql section is used to set up the database for & amarok; under hosts: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use User Name: and Password: to enter the data you need for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The tab last.fm aligns support for last.fm. & amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your user name and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send back played pieces and update the profile: this setting allows & amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Invoking similar performers: after activation of this setting, & amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the respective piece. you can view the list in context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & amarok; requires some of them for example to find modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from freedestop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but Fluxbox will provide for example difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by logging in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & amarok; is more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of them were compiled by & amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version. if, for example, compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed to be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is due to the fact that many programs write data as UTF-8 in meta-information, but do not mark it as a Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the '$ARP [0] file doesn't exist' unless -f $ARP [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& amarok; s Symbols in the status bar (random mode / rerun / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes, the symbol effects are simply forgotten. this allows you to click on a symbol in some cases up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you receive this error: amaroapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok used the correct Qt library.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any colliding Qt or / etc / ld.so.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are solved most easily by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or the developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please only make a mistake if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only an empty playlist will appear. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That's easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the startup subwindow has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 XFast Forward: stars stand for rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select columns. click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this works even if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall there, just as you would do with other files. that's the simple: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar toolbar, right next to the Add button, the button is stored in the playlist. click on it.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & amarok; uses a backend independent approach so the actual question must be what media types are supporting GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support pretty much any imaginable audio format. GStreamer even can decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you will use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which is not included in the default setting (for patent reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 cde, input paste</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa heatsink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to distribute audio at the same time. this can be achieved by means of a sound card with hardware blender (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of your problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">It does & amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure you set artswrapper SUID:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts Driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-Multimedia to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use a different driver (the xine driver was optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dregs react to the visualisations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change to the GStreamer driver, crashes & amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. perform the follow-up register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok in advance!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the @ config / GStreamer-config) and run the registry-register again. start now & amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text box for filtering the collection makes you search for certain items. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the button playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlist, you can add it to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right-click on a playlist, you will find various ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please choose action audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD recordings in WAV format. simply drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the Playback button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the protocol Audiocd: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The burning function is also available in the playlist. just right-click on an entry and follow the burning menu. you have several options for burning a CD here.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed which make work with & amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages on a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as every normal multimedia player has also & amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, has & amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all the others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current part or current stream. directly below is the area, the game time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired game time to the remaining game time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the runtime text display. you can switch through the available Analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be shown in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also found under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ knob is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window is made up of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The & amarok playlist is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be shared in two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right-hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current part. its appearance can be adapted using context-browser design. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & amarok, you might notice that the subwindow launch is gone. the information shown here is now distributed to other parts of & amarok; in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the current piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover artwork of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the play was played for the first time and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to appear in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last part, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & amarok; to download the text for the piece from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then saved in & amarok; s collection database. to do so, no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button searches for a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First of all the pieces will be arranged by artist, and below will be another division after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - sort by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are listed alphabetically by each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - this setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album under the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly beneath the tool bar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. for instructions on how to use this filter, see the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you have different time frames available, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. besides, you can also select your total collection, whereby the filter is virtually shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leaks up the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Hang on Playlist - Adding the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name in which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Adding the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / Burn on CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a composition - Select the selected album as a composition, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up a composition selection - Changes a record selected as a composition back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be displayed under different interpreters but again under the associated artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists quite easy. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Also created Intelligent Playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there, you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used to connect & amarok; for example, to be able to use your iPod with & amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list artist. when you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. when the transfer is complete, quit & amarok; and release the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The tool bar contains a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from an input URL. if you enter e.g. tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press input paste, you can access music from there into the playlist and drop them.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert sloppily files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them. as soon as you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will only appear. to reset the filter, press the button until the text box is empty.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search words separated by spaces, search & amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found, containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, close the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment pool.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. the entries will then receive a tag with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar's toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button to which you can add items to the playlist. right next to it, you will find playlists, empty playlists, and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the tool bar is a unique, magnificable analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example rendition controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars there...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for chance mode and retrieval can be changed easily by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist. using this menu, you can reach the settings of & amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the Visualization plugins window. there you can select the visualizations of & amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by choosing actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to appear in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your large collection in & amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control over the playlist. after you set a piece into the queue, a number appears in the playlist next to the title. this number represents the order in which & amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predefined (the details to set up these will follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on load.fm recommendations (formerly: audioscrobbler). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to use this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist, or click the right mouse button on you and then select charging. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new one.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of chance mix and playlist mix instantly fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist will begin with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection. the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change, so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as the starting point. using the same menu entry, dynamic mode can be deactivated.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that should be kept at the beginning of the playlist. thus, you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each piece played. if you set more than 1, the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right-hand side have already been described in the previous section. on the left hand side of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you want to tick several playlists, & amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists.</seg>

<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is enabled, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not enabled, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the Content View. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and blocking of the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows selecting and dragging files to view the project view. the Content View is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided that a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow range, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the view from the other views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keymapping for it further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct authorizations to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine adjusting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use either the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, therefore your taste and the type of your task is crucial, which of the accompanying programs will give you preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you are using the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Apart from the general & quot; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copycd, formatted DVD, and other functions to generate new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void copyril () void demo.dd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage () void burnDvdImage ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void CreateFolder (QString Name, QString parent) void addurls (KURL url, QString parent) void addurls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void setVolumeID (Qstring path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders, and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -select for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders who encode these wav files (compressing). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (loss-free compression) are supported by default (These Kodiver packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) will be compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if it is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders have to be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodizer gives a small introduction about codecs, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bang any copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even do not deal with the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use to read out a & CD will be explained. this will lead (hopefully) to understand the streamlined interface of the user interface that you will often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which codec programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetch information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, all of which is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the coding settings tab in the setup catalog - the coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the option can be read with a different encoder as the default. it is important to note that before the encoder was configured in the code settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, pies) for program events (such as reading the & CD; ending).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, for setting up the encoder). you'll need to go here before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG mag today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, differences are less important as both codeers generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, like standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression ratio approximately 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs there is often a combination of program settings for the code generator and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding experts explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button identification in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / input the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (remark of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively selecting a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, look for source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must be installed first if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other codes can be added to this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodizer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined coders. more information about the code can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodizer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio codeers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine since it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have write privileges on it (eg; by trying to copy something in with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set up of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably only be done once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each outgoing CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the codec to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them on each reading of a & CD; change if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the output program so that it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device designations for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. there's not much to do here. an additional conversion can be defined here. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you will be notified when information on generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; -Settings. just select both entries. we are convenient and allow the & CD; data will be automatically downloaded from a freedb computer via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet to access the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections have to be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to send data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number at the same time: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; ejected after reading the last piece: check this out to discard the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / needs to be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the wav files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter it as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will build and set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is set up, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process of which is described in this section must be repeated for each outgoing & CD;.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD; don't use it in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data fetched from freedb. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD data manually, instead of retrieving them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this hasn't happened yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, go to the Questions and Answers section for help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD is successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with 'unique' & CD; there, a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation of various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidividual each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successfully retrieving data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album names, but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least at what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoding / file formats. look for help to the Kodizer to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the released CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not share the & CD; for further information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after selecting" "" "OK" "" "you will return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each row of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. simply click on the row to select a piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the button selection of the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the jobs tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right underneath the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message lets you see if you are trying to work with a coder that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format. this takes place reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read out and code. in the case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding (from two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kde, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudiocreator; will entertain within the & kde; CVS as part of the multimedia package. if you are familiar with CVS, you can download from there an anonymous copy. most distributions contain already a pre-compiled package, since & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; package is. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different settings. it is best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it all about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately, no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is considered the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; let it do. at least after contacting with the author. and if you are reading this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this suggestion.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you managed to fetch the source file from & kde; SVN, then you don't need these informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player of & kde; besides others, he has a real-time graphic and karaoke live upliftment of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is involved as soon as it supports a Sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the song text on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; drag a window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the method used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. when you finish playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Abplay in the toolbar, select the record from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (on several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, so press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics text and others do both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically detected, which uses a song so that you do not have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries from the menu Settings menu items or song events. the same function also has buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. this can be found in the collection under the item Organize.... Click on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song to the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the sub-menu of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or press the button arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to skip a song back, select the button Preferred item, the entry Preferred item from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always blades a trumpet to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards GM -compatible (including Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except for the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap"... END Define Keymap "A further key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will specify how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">If your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gunshot. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gunshot), it takes over 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look at the supplied Keywordpress.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped onto the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name Name for this channel will be used. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that receives a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. in the Settings menu, you will find the MIDI Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without being compiled without AWE support. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add any files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check Automatically Add to the Collection beforehand. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or tacked (when I want to play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; drag the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them to a collection, switch the Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid.First you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid.Your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.V and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this animates me to continue programming on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio. Larrose.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying Mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm not spending much leisure time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where you can download MIDI / karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write to me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You are really looking forward to sending me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will count among friends of & kmid; but before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I may have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no-one gets any money for it. I would like to stress that I can only further programming because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, you can also find on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find there links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is reproduced in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback will begin with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / apps folder can also be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, from the View menu and select the next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlists from the same menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be deactivated by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photo: & lt; & lt; bodysuit; & lt; img dur = "search" / lt; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab to configure MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here you can see the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even be used to insert the special embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer module must be specified as service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is taken for a specific type of mime (of course only if this was also determined), this needs to be done by changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the settings below - &gt; Source &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by KMPlayer for the sources different names are used. at the time of the creation of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, dvSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdsource are used. when enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any hints on how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be performed as root after connecting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom drives to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked for performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overtaking. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to be able to master, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dainr.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentone, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], article (DIN) [scrtt], author [scrtt], projector [scrtt], film [prosper], or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: with this the character encoding is set. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for & latex; for integration, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Buch (DIN), Letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users now don't have to worry. it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source text editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see greater areas of a green text on the screen, it is highly likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it is saved by the emphasis on time and anger.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the surroundings, entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) is created by & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the commands of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu Settings... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (apart is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; -Files can be helpful when creating your own & latex. as soon as a DVI, file [data dependent file]] was created, jump & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output type of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-up search, the elements of the DVI-file are linked to the editor and as soon as an item was clicked in the DVI file, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text will jump. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; source code, it will jump to the appropriate place in the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "file surveillance: in this mode, the DVI, file will be" "" "invoked" "" "with" "" "Warp" "" "and there is no call from & Okularline; after quick build." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Other is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, an image, or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Relation: is used for reference to a defined term (selection over a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & out by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ rse is used for defining the fonts. it can be set the fonts for the main text, the footnotes, etc. it is possible to specify the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; two choices are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentone contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] defines the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex source code needs to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or the push of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically triggers the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, the error should be sought after the errors are logged. if you are using Fastening, it should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently than the rest of the document. for example, a report with the written declaration e 12 is created and only a few acid should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} enables the change of the written spaces inside the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are only monitored within the environment (from\\ begin} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be italic represented with\\ emph {word} recursively.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was shown, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a little text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. to do this, mind. a quote, a few passages in the grease and curl pressure and a poem may be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor using editor view or Ctrl E (internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file was created, the document can be printed or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent format (D e V ice I ndependence). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF conversion or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are needed (see below). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI file was created from the & latex; source text, the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers an appropriate setting for all & latex; - binaries. to do this, only Modern under Settings... must be set up... Tools building will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">The mouse-pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text in order to carry out the search query, and then click on pre-text search. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; -viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -Document the corresponding & latex; document from & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; set up as text editor (set up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should there be an error when using Quick Construction of the & DVI cable, an error may be present. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file explains the source code of the source code. in the editor, the buttons Prey LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤tter LaTeX errors can be used for jumping between errors. the logging file always indicates the row in which the error appears. to view the erroneous line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or used as an assistant for the quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Common users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex, file must be opened or created to create a new file.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentone [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used and posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emphasizing many different types of text files (including & deex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters, and to find out more about Kate's possibilities, the manual is to be used to Kate. users of & Kile can start working directly with reading the chapter work with the Editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; offers a very convenient & latex; command reference, which can be called upon the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with the stub button to select the & tex; this means that in this way, when clicking on the\\ par by\\ par\\ bigskip, only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the various kinds of source texts and to highlight these. for example, the & latex commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can enter additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit hock marks or the corresponding key root enable the jump to the next or last jump stamp. this is also highlighted by this jump stamp, so that at the first input of a sign it is automatically translated.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & placeable; already excellent possibilities are added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text always supports & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Rows a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only beuf thing in & kile; is that the slits are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also has & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Posters; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands here for faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to modify the paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, offers & kile; for more commands under Editing Environment for a possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the closing bar in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, it will jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command empowers the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; -group #, will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested welded group clips, the overview can quickly be lost. this command will close the last opened group, so that the nested structure of tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as a device. for the purpose of execution is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple quotes. also for the ending of the application the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and adds two concluding symbols for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There may also be specific settings (e.g. German or French), so that German or French suits can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">For Shift; Shift key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\ with an end-line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; set up... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -Environments and thereby all Et-Notes (amp;) among each other. when Drying Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the current line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & placements; already providing a good source code completion, this was expanded into & kile; in order to implement special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work as needed and the other two are for automatic processing. all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added with the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When you click on the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly the complete list changes. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed when choosing a command. alternatively, it can be used by & Kile, so that a jump to these positions is possible with the right-hand snap mark and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. there may be different lists of lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wipers of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for completion of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are often used that & kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete alteration mode over the Menu Works, or the key-key Alt + Shift key Space, the command to open the environment will automatically be opened and it appears to\\ begin {. thereafter, the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of reverberation mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of abbreviations that are immediately replaced with lower strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode over the menu starts the complete reduction or the key Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L is replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large cups are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been noted that many offices are written more than once in a document.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the settings box... Kile reload can be switched off. here, the threshold value can also be specified for displaying the compensation.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The missing files can be installed in the Folder ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home folder. it is available for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and re-orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped in groups, creating compiling, converting and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compilation of the source text for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used by Alt; 2. after that, the DVI-file can be viewed in the standard-like viewer by means of Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 4; 4 the DVI; file to be viewed in a PS file and by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command quick build, a viewer is usually called after compilation. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will be opened every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... This is where the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kiplepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed using scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a KPart, we begin with the Edit menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all the plugins and add new ones. we describe each and every GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when you add plugins without a location & quantaplus, this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on a project several people work in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 project project properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (her identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important regarding messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Besides the overview of your team there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later you can see how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the addressee list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To insert notes is easy. either the comment must be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword will be entered in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (Role), where nickname is the first name of the Team member, role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject Manager After the area and subproject leaders, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around parentheses and tags: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages supported by DTD agnostic and web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are available via the Settings menu. here, only over & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up by settings of Quanta. this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus, with respect to tags, including car completion, can thus be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / lowercase of tags: big / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal bulk / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal bulk / lowercase, the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags: if checked, will be inserted for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Don't include optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish tag: when enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of various types of files. using the Standard button to recreate the default settings, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in other ways as with file opening open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is broken down from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is broken down from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that the document can be recovered from this backup when a power failure or crash when the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through by modifying the MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behaviour of the PL- and source view in shared mode. see the different modes for see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when editing, and how deep in changing the structure tree is to be automatically opened. empty nodes are empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are grouped into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abdication means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plugins can be managed here. plugins are KPart-applications from third parties, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be given to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading component in "Read Only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Read-KParts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugger has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; -user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action triggers the connection to the debugger, if necessary, or it shares the plugin to listen to Debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that in normal case it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. includes the link to the debugger or terminates the sound according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the checked variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution is resumed. if it is started before a debugging request is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to overloaded variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is halted, the execution will proceed. if it is given before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where it is corrected in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and how you can help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they allow & quantaplus, capabilities such as car completion and node trees. their simplicity and flexibility makes up & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the descriptionrc; and tag XML files with extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symboloriented buttons of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions to insert faster into a document as a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically generated from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carries the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than a single element.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only for tag type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Class method only. specifies the class name where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be blank or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that grouped the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Defines the position of the attribute text within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that terminate a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a broken break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Toolbox is dialog at the top of the & quantaplus; start window and select TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, checking is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, attainable via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a new created & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A action can be set with settings... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned key shortcut. by clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. using this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited to) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus tries & quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be inserted to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus, to the default input. in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">Following the input, the output of the executed application can also be rerouted. there are two types of output: standard output, written to the standard output. it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings Events.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use, enable "Edit Tag Edit Tag," if available so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have any difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what action is doing, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually seen as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. besides the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some dividers in several groups. open the tool bar dialog box settings dialog box settings. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (top left above) for my tool bar. after selecting the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the snaffle supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by trying all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Backup in the right folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your tool bar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust their file descriptionrc, so that their tool bar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # Elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 = Section1.html Sec.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.html tag2 = func.html tag2 = func.html tag2 = func.html tag3 = func.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation something like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Language.basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known border for the shaft depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You realize that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of comma-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and save it to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps / apps</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places, there is a menu entry with Email, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) sending with email, sending toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripted tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. in order to make a contribution, we recommend signing the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team as well as for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the Dialogue New resource, the input fields have to be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD-Package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigate & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, currently not yet by & quantaplus; it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definitions line: the string that will appear in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; it stores all that is selected as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to tool bars with special actions specially designed for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the project folder, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the tree view, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please consult, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reloading, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area will lead to another context menu on the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cutting / copying / pasting), editing the tags on the mouse cursor, using the word under the mouse cursor or opening the file, if the character string is a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, such as & lt; PGT; then click on the icon representing the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree view (QIT;) enables you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate, open it and roam. in the display with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like Add, Remove, Upload or Delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more on Templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands is opened with regard to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears below the other tree view. with it, attributes and namespaces can be changed. the application system that is geared to the content makes it possible to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus, of the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project you can add, edit and view project specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two carers at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all DTD changes are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed specify all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively extended and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; file on your system. therefore autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before your bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a nearby idea: what if & quantaplus, an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & html; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above requirement must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; Developer community. & quantaplus, follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developers, & quantaplus; it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and tool bars automation can increase almost any task. through the program Komsign you can expand & quantaplus. (find out more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for quick web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of the documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or follow helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently being developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code portions and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts a special character to & HTML while inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard to & URL; description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">This is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching the problem porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries predicate or next, depending on the cursor location in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, managed by the project. see the details in chapter & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by setting actions... are added. tool bars are saved through tool bar tool bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (maybe to the & quantaplus) team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be replenished from the & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags menu, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag settings dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; the insertion by tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on it. click on an activated plugins to deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the placard; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-ending identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, change can sometimes take time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is the carbureau mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu has an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence every application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in line with the mouse cursor environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, because, for example, after filling out the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be terminated with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file will be filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here is the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and defaults to toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Note if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be integrated. if a project is started anew from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders will be displayed within the folder and you can make a detailed selection according to your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want through hooks or, by removing the tick, clout of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The latest screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or shift using the Shift; F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders available), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles profile window, high-loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by pointing a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-specified event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was open.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose Open Project... from the menu project or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the right mouse button-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button is dazzled to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">This option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk cache option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e., by simply exchange view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do the most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; best stackable through the menu Toolbars. usage and addition differ. adding tool bars is discussed below in the Add of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-clicking on the toolbar), in which the new action, a new tool bar can be created, other actions can be executed like tool bar, rename toolbar or create tool bars, which can be displayed, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries are added to the action and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code cutters and files for linking. & quantaplus; use templates basically like a common filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have terms for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents by linking (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates. for more information on the Template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organises the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree below global templates. see in for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in template tree under global templates. see for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. at present there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File as template Save As Local Template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree below project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File as template save selected as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged using drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Creating binary templates is easy: copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop, or paste over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder to the right in the file tree or in the project files and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or link them dynamically with & PHP; design, add files or link them to them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow Template template is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / quanta / PowerPoint templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">In order to specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template library. if a root folder is set so, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with matching headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code editor available through the View menu. the first mode substitutes the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to source editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit it, the source code is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 is activated, this mode is already active, the keystroke activates the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via settings Quanta.... By choice of VPL; - View can be selected between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small gap for fast machines and a large gap for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the danish encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. clicking on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column's name and keyword keyword 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS-rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strangely. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and erased via button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via toolbars, as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor day is inserted with text, any other surrounding anchor day needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Sheets Wizard or Lists Assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists have to be used tool bars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3; let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor among the differences windows enables resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are shown visibly. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make it easier by typing just the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Transdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 Folders 3 Folder Folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog notices your selection and displays them next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison or merge of folders will be initiated. if for A file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the open dialog, you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste, and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text to another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane displays the character A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white marks are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the file name and [changing] if you have finished the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the button Springe to next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is simultaneously a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary row in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also make a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">This is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources to ignore the numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl and Ctrl end, siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other keys to edit. using the Paste button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the composition section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-below / Ctrl-top), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture Move forward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the clipboard to clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). if this is enabled, the option selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful, as you may accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the exit and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 Set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog provides also fonts with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered straight. on these systems, the preset button automatically displays an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tabulator button is pressed. otherwise a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 attempts to find all the completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\' at the end of a line, others only save a line feed '\'. usually ignores & kdiff3; the carriage return characters are made visible, but as a white character is treated. during the merge this option must be disabled. in default, this is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the automatic skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white notes are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white notes are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and perform merging. check for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version is attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">To change this option does not affect the current program. you must & kdiff3; exit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is global via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set for each entry separately. if you enable this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Using the selection fields for coding appears a short notice of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define prefabrication commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversee column. but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. make sure you simply remove the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Classifies the comparison windows next to each other or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first committed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only when the line is returned. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your needs. each line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results, but for that an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line terminations to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a preprocessing command for line removal is needed, because $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you like those regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line retrieval. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every mark between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, i.e. quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER "However, perl needs some details. where used\\ (and\\) is needed perl only needs (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor are retained for the display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm looks like.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can use & kdiff3 to recursively compare and merge whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before startup,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually carrying out them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... carries selected actions either with all (F7 key) or only selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files listed until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is complete, show & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or double-clicking on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the join action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed of problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the color red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire contents are identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes red and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (for example, if A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified, and if the option is synchronizing directories. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical afterwards. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge selected (unsure) is enabled, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and displays the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after another. the status column shows skill when merging was successful, and corresponding other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If a full-time analysis is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge either the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected any merging actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode C is used as destination, in the two-folder merge, B is chosen as destination and when syncing A and / or B is used as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the folder structure, also in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to just merge the current entry, select the current element's action, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Options, Creating, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you only want to see what would happen without the real changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message will appear and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) do not merge again later. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the Elementum. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e. g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checking for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Results in a full analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of solved, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter an appropriate anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">There is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they are equal. this can, for example, be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge is assumed that the other file has not been changed either. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of single files, not just the merge of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the Folder View menu remains visible during the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the Folder & Text windows to the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and the text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a file from the merge menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge. to do so, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be placed on registration and the file will not be merged again if you launch the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slave. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. this allows you to specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or change date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Trust of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a Difference Viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first starts with the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview into - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my say thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or let him go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure installs in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has so far been too large. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor needs to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly appears; No src lints; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; use already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kde3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how you can use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For a list of recent changes, see http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have problems with compile. if you still encounter difficulties, please report to the e-mail list.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) Copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you have to re-read the folder with the update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder while merging. if the target folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C source below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the workspaces, change their size, stop them or postpone them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running therein. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The contextual menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries pager to set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and name of the application as well as the entries will minimize, maximize, apply to desktop and finish. the commands will do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; indicate the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, and eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is enabled, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main window can be determined: classically & kpager; in a 2xN-grid, all virtual desktops appear in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with its contents and move outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and set up selecting switch... allows the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagblc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign a value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on high-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag; launch, a window appears as shown above. the main window of the screen shows the enlarged area of the screen. below, this window is referred to as magnifying window. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">As an alternative, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select window) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse cursor being displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note that the mouse pointer is not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection screen mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key or the & Mb; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window stays solid and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops updating the display. stopping the update causes the CPU time needed to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (very low, low, medium, high, very high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is on the same spot for a while. it is thought to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool, to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic relief items, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and results in a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart push is activated, make & kmousetool; now move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement until the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way you can execute the pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent push requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait before releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through the mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delay, you can & kde; move to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slide control sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this feature is currently only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window surrounds please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent move should be switched off. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart push.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware in which places a mouseclick remains unaffected: clicking on the neutral component of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not result in unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse sphere, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">At first you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape off with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you have a mouse click itself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the mouse on where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. this way, accidental mouse clicks may cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the cover lines from windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart push is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very possible to mark text, copy it to clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart push when you just start using & kmousetool; instead, select a mouseclick at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible click of the mouse. as a result, each time a mouse click is played, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shooting period starts. later, you can use the intelligent move without the audible click of the mouse. but for that it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; you must install the XTest extension for & X Window. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and it is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to the moths.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; it can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button. in this way, drag and drop can be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, you can choose the standard textbook dictionary. you can often choose text passages from the text passages without typing them. of course, the text passages can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot) you determine the dictionary for the words supplement. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can reconcile the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispenser program. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech disseminators" works with a text. & ktts; distinguish four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is too hot. a warning takes precedence and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; notifications are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you initiate from the map is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are thought for the edition of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are executed in queue, except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of these reads, this output is halted and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined string substitute filters, which facilitate the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting news from & conciling; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders dependent on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the Spokesperson Speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the filter type, and the further below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the setup of character chaining filters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the respective replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erbet column. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks one of the languages registered here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You will get the application ID running programs with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 shows, you may only enter Copete.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated. so check the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the ktts website; for information that is not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech synthesizer program uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to expand using another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for transmissions or downloaded the currently created tarball, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use Desktop, check whether speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts, which uses the speech synthesis program. the kttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech dispatchers is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text will be divided into separate sentences. the user can go back set or paragraph, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application has text on & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be automatically chosen the best matching speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a speaker choosing, you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to add a speaker to the list, and so that a speaker is inserted in the list, or click Edit, the panel display will be displayed. as an example, the unit of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in case of voices that are & ktts; this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These sliders adjust the volume, speech speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a number of controllers and this grey is displayed, the chosen voice will not allow you to adjust these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is more quickly synthesized (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed ktmgr in the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol kttsmgr is visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and dictatmgr is not running, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all jobs in the queue are listed, along with the application setting the job, the current status of the job, the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card card spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can pre-select or return to the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Clicking OK will make all changes to the settings (also on the other index cards) and ktmgr will be resized to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are shown in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the speech speed here. 501;% equals about half and 200nbsp;% about twice the normal speech speed. in order for these adjustments to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to apply the new settings for the running & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are installed in your system. most of them will not work. you will have to find out which device works for you. in case of doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the orders received are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you let & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can start with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, the audio output will be added to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the incoming message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the output of screen reavers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts, read KNotify messages, run kttsmgr and click Notifications. the tab alerts appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable reading & kde; if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played are written by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message sending & Conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are written by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this selection box to specify what & ktts; do when an event occurs. you have the following selection options:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired speaker. standard selects the speaker, which is shown in the list on the list of the speaker as top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a certain event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The Event All Notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. to do so, you can set the default notification as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notifications to a file. use the button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events are merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. furthermore, brands for controlling pronunciation, for example abbreviations. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the issue of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / / www3.org / TR / speech / speech / speech / speech synthesis "</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). thus, SBDs can begin to subdivide text into individual sentences. thus, you can skip or stop or stop orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filters. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up as default. you can change its settings or add other set limits filtering filters, but beginnings will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn pronunciation is to try out the speaker selection and select text to read. check on the card selection, which speaker & ktts; select, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to set more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Comment Filters match text with a regular expression for punishers and insert a tab character (decimal code 8) at the set boundaries (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knight), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal statute detection filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The Carter Card Speaker Selection allows you to overwrite the subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card speaker). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">If you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set-up properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property has priority over other properties. you can also place multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the issue, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a specific application sends text in a different language than the default in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the characteristics of the speaker, which is most likely to be deleted, click on the standard speaker select and then use the speaker that best matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; it was finished. probably you need to register GStreamer. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, you may need to install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output about ALSA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time. when I get a text order, freezes & ktts; ein. on the Console; appears a message saying: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is the problem that conflicts arise with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. for possible solutions, please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed them and can use them in Festival, but kttsmgr does not display this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivals.com. If this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you have found the voice, send to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the cartridge card. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -by-SSml converter filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it happen that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female Festival spokesperson, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER doesn't seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file throws the xsl file to convert from SSml to Saber the GENDER tags. the same goes for the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom chainring release filter and now I can go in & Desktop; no more stately default or return. on the Purchase Orders it is shown, the order consists of only one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). use a filter for propositional symbols instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure the GStreamer modules are registered by using GStreamer in & ktts; invoke the follow-up register. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedestop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflict with ALSA during audio output. if your system also counts, you can not simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freeze when you start a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005 aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The sox audio program is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables the management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings across a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selection of K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; Start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf to display the device at all and enable the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the network settings option in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and release date. by checking the setting of non-return requests, the option can be hit durably.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you enter system management mode at the right bottom end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>

<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Extended Settings button shows the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are retrieved from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The choice of manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address you need to specify the desired TCP / IP address. in the input field network mask, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface at boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name given by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers are only able to understand IP addresses. if the host requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator is a simple management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be placed in priority by selecting a entry and add-on or downgrading in the list with buttons down or down.</seg>

<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set in a & konsole.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), it is enough when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical user interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf will be discussed; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace more knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at the & eg; work place, the network administrator is the contact point that a valid IP address is filed or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected for this purpose reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own host). the default route is required for IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf are affected and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripting in SuSEconfig. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first consisted of creating a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& dat, rejuvenate the tape and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & dat; do not recognise the preview on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & dat; the preview, it searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was included. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the tape by unfolding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat can be used, it must be formatted by & dat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & dat; it requires that a tape before being used must be formatted. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape and the capacity drives & kdat; with formatting the tape away. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a safety profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select in the Save menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the backup will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only be checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick on any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can re-establish the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the record for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the Restore dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band indexfile on the basis of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can recreate the index in two ways from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files located in the same filesystem are backed up like the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry will be viewed by tar independently of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files that have changed since then will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that has been used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding variant of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & dat; before the tape is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & chdat; to lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting doesn't work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, it will be automatically ejected when releasing the device. do not use this option on floppy drives.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & chdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must communicate the block size for your tape drive in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n te) The tape ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, whereby the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the period in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be directly administrated with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. moreover, experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system lays down the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems occurring on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, tries to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't see it, and it opens a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter out a string in the filter bar. the list of the protocol lines will now be changed automatically so that only the protocol lines will be displayed, which will be displayed to the selected filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be shown if the string of filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, then show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than protocol lines of the step hint. the color representation of protocol lines can be turned in setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather familiar (and named as renamed) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly develops into the standard for the control of the program start when starting the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not address historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not among / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start when starting the system or switching to another running level. system services do not include such things as Network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port when you boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have messed up on the inittab file. if you have messed up something, then get it restarted by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no real files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called start with the argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user running level, the & b; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Running level (or its position). this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new area. in order to only copy them to a new level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, running level 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorter number or the name of an entry, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runways, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Type in the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; running under RunLevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check that all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, it may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this guide can be attached to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save to the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group by double-clicking on the entry. it will display the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space constraints (quota) for users will create a card that allows you to customize individual settings. other flashcards appear if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD's Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management tab appears if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, are installed like in BSD _ Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears, if at least one embedded filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations of each file in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system with wildly limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups Map groups provide information on the group affiliation of the selected user. the standard group, which the user owns, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user resp. the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO System Manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change, change, change, and more.</seg>
