although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would live there for the first time now .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
when I was 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free for Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never thinks of the mountain as it is so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted in favor with him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which records people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ et Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles with the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump broke his way to the nom@@ ine@@ e Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , it is hard to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look differently from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O.@@ B. : white against all other ethnic groups ; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash play on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as whi@@ pl@@ ash trauma ) as the great Van Jones called , killed exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its President , twice the son of an Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge portion of the white America has this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this , I have to remember K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier killed in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is now rush country , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recy@@ cled Instrument Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca and the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura have in common ?
the fact that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a few years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which , together with their musical instruments , has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ c violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and playing in the bu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , tim@@ ber@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga to play .
music from Tr@@ ash
more than 7.@@ 000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the supervision of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash produced from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
a documentary named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ land@@ fill ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic fills the orchestra with its inspiring performance of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even performed his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already been fishing illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law criminal this way to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ ators , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to port one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the region &apos;s waters : he was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia for lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which cris@@ sc@@ ros@@ ses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had expelled the prime minister from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate contemp@@ t of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fisheries can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while action against illegal fishing was ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , which circul@@ ated information among individual countries , the actions today are happening in real time , track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that were noted or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also pays attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to label ships fishing in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its captured fish on its way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can indicate whether the participating boats have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also if they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay the pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD on lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters every year .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; specifically , they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You may not run my harbor &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 tests of susp@@ icious ships .
it uncovered criminal networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st of Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered from satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different information levels . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better picture of who is doing what is - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to investigate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the pursuit of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and barely reck@@ oned with consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats buy more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries joined together in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting the illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . . &quot; security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans really works in the entire ocean .

street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s presi@@ dency .
this picture by Mar@@ Ã­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis were going into empt@@ iness , gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the sec@@ rec@@ y of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of many is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the election alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or a short MU@@ D ( for example : round Table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves broke the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise one could see something that many national Gu@@ ests do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that sets the scale of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets .
My@@ t@@ onian Media Lab@@ s to :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has undertaken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in CÃ³r@@ doba , Argentina .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in CÃ³r@@ doba province .
in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP systems .
don &apos;t be surprised if you don &apos;t kid@@ nap you some@@ day and I &apos;ll have to save you .

that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he told me that I would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so my father had brought me up .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; there the prisoners are tortured . &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he told me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything was possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and told me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured .
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the person &apos;s body which was tied up there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it on with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was terrible ... like a dirty wind@@ le .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became ey@@ eb@@ rows .
he talked to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me elsewhere ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survivors Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial , accused the students of Rau@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , runs through the former torture chambers .
the path on which you came here is also the path on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this way and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &quot; boot@@ y of war &quot;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military jun@@ ks that are taken away from an enemy that has been fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then that is not boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always asked myself how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , hit me and scre@@ amed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller collar of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home .
at that time the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and recognizes that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why leave the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ ding children ?
one day my father brought a girl back home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why leave their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families that could be passed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that man can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something stays always there .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even participated in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; they were supposed to defend were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , please show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I delivered the first ad .
I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally cancelled my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the size of the sentence in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended due to crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court rendered lifel@@ ong imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ it@@ ances .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on fair@@ ness for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the land on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be set up , which is now run by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes elderly people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; terrible car &quot;
the shield with the translation error at a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , in which one can extend his driving license .
the photograph was spread in the social media .
adaptation of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnesses to a very un@@ successful translation last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ ling@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; was fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with a vi@@ cious h@@ ind - and # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the correct , although gram@@ mati@@ cally correct designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( the translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by senior citizens has risen during the same period .
the un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to light on the published version of the article , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation really not , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all of Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , tasting or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees , leave translations in a company @-@ internal manner . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and enig@@ matic phrases that arise by machine translation show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewelry . but from major companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar to Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later on , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the Executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection had been sn@@ apped and advised users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to gain access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again blocked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting about protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission looked at this as a &quot; appeal to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT@@ IO@@ L later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly tran@@ sm@@ its its meetings .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond in@@ correctly to requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third channel closed , the transfer was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to receive a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other cri@@ adi@@ tas , which were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house once more and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That is what has become of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ er for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money hands over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over her head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay inn@@ um@@ erable days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ di@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ tical - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ a@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced them .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated on the cri@@ ckets guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ a@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl with her and justi@@ fies exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ a@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent impacts . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ tical in the household of the former military family Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 residents located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ er .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ di@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest in protest and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; to be in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ented Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded rapid examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ tical .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be ground@@ breaking - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to trial .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ tical
the cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to sign up and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent as a cri@@ adi@@ er to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
for example , on Fri@@ days , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to have dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the household &apos;s library as food from the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings , the owner of the house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would again learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed to lose again .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in the school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to cri@@ ckets when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ er .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt especially clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and n@@ anny in Paraguay .
the host of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to you .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ u@@ by wrote that she would have an el@@ event@@ h girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ u@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the ad cre@@ pt once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I wonder if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?
( Cri@@ tical as long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ tical tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) where the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ( the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guaran@@ Ã­ ) had to pay tribute .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ a@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted in favour of a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning the use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law would then be set up a place that is assigned to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine .
the bill , composed of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video axes and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose registration on users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul S@@ att@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall around Facebook on a national level . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research technologi@@ sts &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative fÃ¼r Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly believe in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for a permit or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically far from realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed with Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and asser@@ tion will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those convic@@ ted of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian leop@@ ard in the war drawn by war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold has been published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the leop@@ ards , who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of Leop@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team therefore states in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife in wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an region are set up .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia .
his works have been published in numerous international publications including TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the north @-@ east of Japan , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a variety of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast which experienced both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already alone for this reason , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing facility in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned spare parts were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ ac@@ uation of kes@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters ( also forced to reloc@@ ate cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) to the final replacement buildings .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in these dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the people who ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful .
for I@@ w@@ ate , this figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to identify , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident suffered large @-@ scale agriculture in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but here too Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants make it harder to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper published numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ates . she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper increasingly focused on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 160@@ ,000 ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in early 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent surro@@ unde houses .
according to the state of 2017 , still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ ika Kri@@ con@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she has collected with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police on nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana beat him against his head .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
the pictures show the police officer &apos;s face , attacking a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which it is seen how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards .
another video , filmed with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo An@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he had joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group were sab@@ ot@@ aged only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick .
police Tak@@ eover Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s wasn &apos;t the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers sat at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators set up a platform for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , a social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has covered street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo precisely reported a broken glass window to display their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journalist reason to report about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause .
this must also be acknowledged if one is strictly opposed to any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also has an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance here , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of Cuba that are forgotten by de @-@ induc@@ ing
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich church , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ an@@ que , is commonly known as the Central Central - at Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no real crop of sugar on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after gro@@ unding the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete structure remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories which are still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is rising every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in use after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production tot@@ alled 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive , they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
but the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os a pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural Policy &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on began the restructuring process in the sugar industry .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated the most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same thing : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
officially written documents were distinguished only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factory which was still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he removed one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important counter@@ parts producer was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community Greg@@ ori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to disman@@ tle it , they also stopped raising the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remain imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a self @-@ supporting person , yet he is not giving up the lies that were told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations youngsters use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
capturing a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - The Gra@@ y Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders from 2014 have direct access to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances .
the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago strain in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not always native to the languages of First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation picked up , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go ahead with our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the commentary piece , the reader and champion of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and inserts the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ i ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( in addition to a typical restaurant in Japan ) .

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u ( the &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ wering district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend transforms them today into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin gently .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone tapes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tokyo department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into tack@@ y items , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food comple@@ tions is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an emperor @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art . in this case , ic@@ ura and salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon boo@@ ths ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , but also in # H@@ ash@@ tag .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these mirrors do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , Chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Car@@ tel , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug trade &quot; ) , to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who have been involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and car@@ tels .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fear Change &quot; ) nar@@ rates these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches for hidden graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews only a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves for the task we have asked ourselves to go and look for graves after the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
he left the house on 13 October .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay her because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fragi@@ lity and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a woman of animal pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the violence of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not agit@@ ated and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been rob@@ bed with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money out of her business month for month , until in the end they destroyed not only the business but also tore down her family .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain over it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the ver@@ ge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , keep tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , who saw the bloody murder of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 cups a day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this contribution and the pages to which he links contain images depicting violence .
the factor check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker trol@@ ley crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were scor@@ ned .
a picture with the title &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
there are numbers of char@@ red bodies str@@ ung on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t come to an end .
over the years the same photo was put up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses were in the streets and in the bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been cut , shot or burned .
only by means of satellite images the follow @-@ up period could be displayed metap@@ hor@@ ically .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from DR Congo , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented ordin@@ ances to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange was also associated with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who escaped were able to flee blows , rape and many dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , which fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s president Th@@ an had said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not linked the image of the DRC .
the worldwide range of false data
traces of these false links date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ y@@ has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) that are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , others have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked together ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
card : news Fra@@ mes .
examples of false cou@@ plings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ colored countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this contribution , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only identifies the false statements , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions after the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ ventions after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , clearly have seen no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post of U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator Pam@@ ela G@@ eller .

Iran , 2012 .
a German student of the@@ ology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the district of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news to his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s bom@@ b@@ ings in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a review of what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately targeted news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ Ä@@ Ñ@@ Ð¸@@ Ñ@@ Ñ@@ Ð¸@@ Ð¸ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of DR Congo is NOT Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , released from the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , which is now deleted , has expressly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , appeared and spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that allegedly took place on behalf of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) but the messages related to it have not been taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message circul@@ ated by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
from the embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ y ) , Tin@@ tin also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture might ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that perme@@ ate these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally do share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this sen@@ timent of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and bel@@ lows the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has been deb@@ ated extensively ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that forci@@ ble images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely impro@@ per way .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog un@@ v@@ eils the sing@@ ul@@ arity of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world , which are difficult or at all not to be translated .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Aci@@ d ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but they all resist every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s VAT , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognizing the way around you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after getting war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite subjects here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing after a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster zone of 28 May 2017 .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ all settled on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene ratios of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . t@@ witter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods devast@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children writes after further rain@@ falls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a was also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ crafts for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies to the residents in their flooded villages .
various organisations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ut@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ol @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the data center is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ hai introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for floods and land@@ slides .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka in which several social media platforms are fully exploited bring security and help to residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we will expand rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , other cann@@ on slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they were obli@@ vious to me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in , will be reli@@ eved .
being un@@ m@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone with that .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Muslim Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , as did the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these paintings still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the past three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female candidate for 2016 .
this narrative is failing to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has made our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ viral attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
among the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rati@@ ves that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to record the 1.7 billion Nar@@ rati@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where seven million Muslims represent the highest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
approved . approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother presented her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were inv@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now ir@@ onic Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim prescri@@ p@@ tions or my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t wear all the ash@@ ags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks , and experts for mis@@ information that have manipul@@ ated our already fla@@ wed picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who runs the head@@ sc@@ arf to a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques around the US , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ Islam hostili@@ ty in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes up our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslims when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter if I kept her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved . approved .
belonging is the picture of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi a few decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her accomplished and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi Holy Spirit ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslims means speaking the prayers that they had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; which created a company with the name Hon@@ orable British East ini@@ dia Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved . approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an has wept for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all of them to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he traveled into more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white terrorist .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that a African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel as people crowded out airports in order to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1,7 billion contains more possibilities than a cube of magic but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this branch .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries it bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Have to Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply devoted to neg@@ ating the Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we dis@@ continue in our news au@@ ctions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ anen ; the video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ apphire Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned because of this difficult global timing we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; they now dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old , as my daughter is now , but who have made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim today .
things that I left here like a bread cro@@ oked lane in my speech .
things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie where one is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Kon@@ vers@@ ations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred scholars talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were neg@@ ated by the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination , was even scientific of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously , to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occup@@ ying that we have no president , the chocolate cake is feeding , while he already sp@@ ends broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now , despite a language barrier ?
Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling Initiative ( T@@ LS ) , is telling stories in their original language a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices told recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to , to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to focus on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion , as though the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the tale of h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story narrative .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of public debt from the US
on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico . the march started at the capital of the capital , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ ter@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
Puerto Rico &apos;s people demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deter@@ red by falling pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the United States sovereign territory - suffers from a serious financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on corporate responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from outside will run risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bears the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is held in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ research ) .
the book published last year and available here license @-@ free contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge , and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the list of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have not received any information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who imagined herself as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and state remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Man , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded in Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ vision@@ ally than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lis@@ ations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural inheritance of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el did not finish this project until now .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ clamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardi@@ ans
I forget the prison crow@@ ding
and I &apos;ll go into every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
one year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
the tale of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have been incar@@ cer@@ ated under the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : sentenced to prison on account of corruption
Mozambique re@@ acted to corruption in which a government member res@@ igned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years in prison .
the money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique , whose council was presi@@ ded over by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good leadership in 2016 and immediately called for rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which issued an application , there would be no grounds for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ enter its former position , as the company did not conduct any disciplinary proceedings following its detention .
however , many people don &apos;t like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integ@@ rity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
however , the company apparently remained silent and made no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been cut off .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ate speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
quite disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil say that the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that he had insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality to return to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of the Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el prison that Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve , and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he was sitting for 10 years and was free .
and today the company , in which he mis@@ ses money , is under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Î»@@ Î¯@@ Ï ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or split@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took over their posts from the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the Word or expressed doubt in order to use it were cens@@ ored .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings having the same sequence of letters as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ mes@@ an also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ alter b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook had to be more analy@@ tic before all the posts that were suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ be@@ hook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age brackets ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate language , get a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was &quot; not consistent with the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intent or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hate within the various communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the deleted posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are removed from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critici@@ zed for its failure to control hat@@ eful hate speech on its Burma sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on context than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago at the end of the day
a wedding ring in the sand .

the mono@@ gam@@ y is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament has unanim@@ ously adopted a law that will forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age @-@ capable age is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ s@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organization ( I@@ RO ) , said that the state should not interfere , as this is not the age of maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that in 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements dedicated to aboli@@ shing children &apos;s marriage laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for instance , had no qual@@ ms about saying to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ ned , take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook that re@@ posted Les@@ lie Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one voted against it .
after it was previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws of child@@ birth had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft to am@@ end the marriage legislation was decided today on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs voted against have voted in favour of the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
con@@ gr@@ ats . congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hit@@ ch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to release his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite lawful for Mahar@@ aj to oppose the law , most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
rather than talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we , the state in our bedrooms , would simply talk about the fact that the state , our daughters , would be mis@@ used by the fact that they might be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child@@ care is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

Turkish users can re@@ visit Wikipedia content by mirr@@ oring web pages
the Wikipedia page , which is English @-@ speaking , was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia based on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information .
both students and re@@ porters and TV @-@ series fans defend themselves against the block .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using circum@@ vent@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , there are regular block@@ ings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the world &apos;s best @-@ known country when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computers ) which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is still available despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in store sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia had been involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors , when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported to Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
one acc@@ esses to another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a Su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
S@@ ag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he looked around around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and selected colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , S@@ ag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first class position helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was just sitting at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a leop@@ ard would be .
the dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leop@@ ard was in and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
S@@ ag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain international recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he had already seen tig@@ ers face to face with face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .

also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz@@ word appeared . he sat down immediately , we looked at us and he star@@ ed me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals S@@ ag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
take a look at some of these photos below .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid women with the utmost care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that because of their social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a false court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relative with name .
the tradition not to call their wives by their names is also common among men . however , they have far fewer responsibilities to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he , in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one out of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ min@@ al which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ yer has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
it tells how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who do not call their hus@@ bands by their names .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
not to speak out loud the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom which they all keep up with guilt and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name , wanted to try at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him now by his name .
Roh@@ ini started his first discussion club with this confidence in his luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; shouldn &apos;t it be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands to the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking up a century @-@ old tradition in which married women should never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that she only chu@@ ck@@ led in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline to have broken with an age old custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband &apos;s husband was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the sp@@ ouses :
why do women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red point if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not ceased altogether , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry , who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives , they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have had only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of one &apos;s own dress code , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned her own pair of cur@@ tas ( upper @-@ shirts ) into a discussion lap so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion evening , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly :
so far , we have only taken small steps .
some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of her husband .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling over more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on 29th June this year , the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the Beat@@ les visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turn in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is today in Japan . they were here in Tokyo before 51 years ago .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is intended to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane

the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of marketing technology , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ( today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could this be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
this is how the day is proceeding today .
so , we hope you &apos;re there !

men of bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that men of bald men could be targets of attacks in Mozambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trafficking , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man headed by a man can bring gold or bring wealth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , which is the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police were waiting for the latest assass@@ inations of three male @-@ headed men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ bands Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ Ã¯@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MAN E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ME is ashamed A country in which the people would have shame to go to the street , to offer sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation where people would pursue honest pursu@@ its or even hun@@ ted their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ are headed for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida &apos;s Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic t@@ witter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ app@@ r , as well as the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ are @-@ headed :

he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who themselves were themselves insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tille &apos;s stay and the Constitution were unknown until today ( August 01 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work will prove to be a pioneer of Open @-@ Web @-@ Movement .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( endanger@@ ing state ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a speaker says that he considers it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have fully wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should put pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ enden have refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China , as exports had largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top @-@ ranking diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an announcement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they are meant to meet and receive all visits they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the embassy aff@@ or@@ ded the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim to comply with Chinese constitutional law and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

United States of America
German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was issued on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had major concerns whether the fuss surrounding Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s attorney told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to anyone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow those rights to be enforced for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France - France
France &apos;s foreign ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , and in addition , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will finally accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the ill intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid , since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark caused a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore , because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one ce@@ ases to say that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from the author@@ itarian rulers , preten@@ ding to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ ons the twisted logic , since it is better suited to its power .
in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he warned such questions in a rational way with non @-@ rep@@ lies .
Rachel Z@@ eng is calling on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to make clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out that one should start reading the entire message of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes he is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks down the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are considered only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return to ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to be Singapore and has always been a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should speak more about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series of rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I reply . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live in Japan .
depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is considered poli@@ te to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook internally from anger , if they are kept for Americans but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know what to do , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can attach a Canadian flag to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are poli@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I &apos;d switch to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
mit Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being sk@@ e@@ tish - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would in fact be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can stum@@ ble .
to be harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Thailand Jun@@ ta
a popular pop band in Thailand released a music video which the jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ dy , which in 2014 seized the power and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , still reign@@ s the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tattoo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes a young man who tells the rules of his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly politically , the music video indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 tunes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was even blocked , after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which grants the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjustment change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest milit@@ ants and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict ban against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is slowly re@@ covering in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Geor@@ gian war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show marked pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Cau@@ cas@@ us , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet power in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ n@@ oses live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ zh@@ kov@@ ka , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and seldom they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which minist@@ ered to the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty residents .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave in front of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart is forever staying in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while telling her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day it reminds of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia broke simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she says that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our discussion bows to the end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children is now pursuing the ball scre@@ aming .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood that care for uncertainty in their lives .
you don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is headed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink go@@ ose @-@ frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears @-@ Form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 per night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the stor@@ er@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , the people come in full @-@ sized bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
currently it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived previously in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to sell .
he started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar a night .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travelers regularly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves with numerous photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats each time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ in point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users is scheduled to close by the site
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile user in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message is said to prevent the app from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities did not use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police informed that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app , with the children &apos;s filters for min@@ ors , is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
of course , an app with these features can be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; images from mainland China &quot; ) , published by cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents random@@ ly to check if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of bon@@ dage by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .

after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government departments , authorities and affiliated organisations , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , a US human rights organisation , also referred to these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; in the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything that is important has disappeared .
everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth clearly recognis@@ able from inside and outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who gives honor to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality catches you up and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters change into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out to death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power to us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ out the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
all the districts desired , only my own did not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not make high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night , things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we turned to a magnificent picture full of my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you have scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel of Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; top Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really gri@@ eving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause as I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is in my nose till this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I had been exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I walked through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I &apos;ll sing all the details exactly before I enter the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they have given me a larger cell this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to share it with just one other prisoner and must immediately put me without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ fashioned way of communication : hitting the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first resp@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after some hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness no prominent facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will be interro@@ gated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to chase away all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
from a distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that Schwarz was the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us with the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; allu@@ ding to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : in order to protect the security against us and prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect , so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and revealed the close field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal &apos;s c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the interro@@ gation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the facial expressions that sli@@ ps him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest in demonstrations that will eventually come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished without being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to give me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated , while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and did not find any pleasure in it , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged rod .
electricity f@@ lowed up my whole body enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness van@@ ished and the pain was there again .
after two aw@@ ful hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fu@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must have terrible troubles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you &apos;re gon@@ na be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ oms to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine stained lips .
he lives on the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ental , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he har@@ bors a special a@@ version to U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water @-@ dissolved Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the sm@@ el@@ iness of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the cock@@ ro@@ aches of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that question the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who still chose to use &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply a shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflected in a more and more clear @-@ reaching reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to Lei@@ be &apos;s traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years the number of &apos; hon@@ ours &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official ones left un@@ official .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime fighting from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be det@@ ained in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music is also very popular and is well known for not shy away from issues that are long considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was fed up with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b examines the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse often repe@@ ats :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one , in his words , can &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were ri@@ pped out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b adverti@@ ses for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems today .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ is , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they were critical in social media comment@@ aries on the problems related to corruption that were deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial nature . at least he hopes this .
until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of western Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
for a long time I look at the Meg@@ uro For@@ jo@@ en : two fixed wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breath @-@ taking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high rate of crime , where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad ratings a training in the hair art that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities to offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district to which we are very proud , because out of love for the children we built this educational community .
Colombia : letters of love to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After@@ T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel ej@@ ected to accom@@ o@@ date affection ?
it was precisely this question that the two young Colom@@ bian activists led Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation no longer inspired them and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la M@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , which encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace agreement was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as who have lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried arms around the clock must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must join together and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day Inspiration for the Campa@@ ign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former com@@ bat@@ ants of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i would never have thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very touching moment for all those involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; said political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I entered one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go there , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gr@@ en@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over my che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was tired of the war , tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices heard
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leader joined a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already at war and the F@@ ARC already operated in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC stated the history of the organization , its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to making society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned up@@ side by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms , stand up and protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , to a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to elev@@ ate themselves above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ rov

this is the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ ing@@ owa and whose first publication was published on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs above the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not just over night .
OC media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta , throwing a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities that arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman .
as she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the gender equality of their land wife , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of her life , she went to the US in the last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I have been working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents went round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to undo a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; This is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the last analysis .
apparently some women had heard everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC media : in which cases were you laid - in which men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor knew and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said that I had to prove it by running through the streets above without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark@@ ened windows and a plate plate with a 95 on it stood .
after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that there was a little lazy .
my human rights friends tested the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering me , without passport , without knowing everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; don &apos;t you think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people already know which hotel you put in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still carry me in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this emotional barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually try to look at how the person looks at the person she rec@@ alled from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have remained dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was hard to wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; glory &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are men still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to surrender to Cad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately di@@ pped in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison are gone after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was there himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to approach us originally to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ lisation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked out ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wearing red@@ dish jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they laugh at the sick .
OC media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the map .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he did not talk about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand , looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic grew steadily worse .
OC Media : what activity do you take now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise tea lists , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t pay a cent for that .
I discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ apped the variety of cur@@ es .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam before the mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ ge@@ ants have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about transitions to men who love men , and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , in order to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know I &apos;m now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , such as Ah@@ wa &apos;s human rights groups who would like to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video posted on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month , several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ az@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have met .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ rons who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable arable land for Iranian farming .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ ti@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among Arab a@@ haw@@ ks has increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , gradu@@ ating from primary school , finished 55 % of secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ shi@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young ancestors .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the sett@@ ling process :
because function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country .
there are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ ra@@ zi , as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I am not identifying myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photograph . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women , especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists , respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be fem@@ inists .
for example , women today still earn less money than men despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still tra@@ vers@@ ing across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I bond twice and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I get to speak on skin color , on racism , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we &apos;ve always been ab@@ used under racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , in both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices up and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alized violence in an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we face black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold way .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement as black women , in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which relate both to the sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alised being in a historical way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to drive forward their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the over@@ lap of skin colour and gender , because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming itself ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) , we can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alization after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a again and again travelled in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over women &apos;s mor@@ als in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena displayed because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the adverti@@ sed ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not benefit .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her message .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
they generally do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to law enforcement authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and St@@ ati@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system , which is nothing under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation blows and statistics
it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General issued 9@@ 600 noti@@ fications of domestic violence . 70 % of these cases were used for violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who wants to report to Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this will come to any woman who has suffered from physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
in August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay as a result of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ estimate
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this was to be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer has Carlos together . but for two years she has endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had dropped from Carlos so long and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who is not born in Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in some way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ tori@@ an &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she conducted a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ rable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it mainly went for money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # Elec@@ sys ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ini@@ d must be declared a criminal off@@ ence and punish har@@ sh@@ er as is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the bill has been changed in some respects to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law advoc@@ ating that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , which is currently banned in Paraguay and is pun@@ ishable by up to five years &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry on their own if they simply want to report and obtain a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates itself and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the bill was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that caused the partners in cases of domestic violence to be re@@ conc@@ iled .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the passage concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he is liable to imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after having dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Defense Minister , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the sec@@ rec@@ y intelligence , to limit public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , and torture and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was charged by ISS to the Special Department and arrested by the security forces on his arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information gave the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper in any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , inter alia , for disorder in public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the prestige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison terms and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit was set in the amount of 5,000 US dollars ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronoun@@ cement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ plen@@ ish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in Oman the freedom of the press has recently been viol@@ ated .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensuring that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports and supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to assemble , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons why there are two reasons for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists will help build own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for the Research of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS Epide@@ mic pointed out the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Var@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receiver , rather than being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
the system that magazines can make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change world food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has been limited by its own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce can be obtained .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents were not only for individual types but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cereals or car@@ tons . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a thousand @-@ year @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton continues to grow salad , but it takes longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der around which I have to commu@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new variety of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes as good as possible and tries to breed the traits he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of Out@@ break Gor@@ geous in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement origin@@ ates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may obli@@ ge that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; breeders merely allow others who buy their seeds , cross it to grow their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy views
for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
consequently seed plays a role in greater coher@@ ence such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; if you want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as is offered on farmers markets , you should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others . thus , their approach is to be patented in contrast to seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly shr@@ inks due to increasing intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore becoming more limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetically variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all car@@ tel features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either at all or even more difficult .
such estimates are not yet available to other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat can be patented in an even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves , through which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ speaking C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property affects other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other way : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires will certainly not promote innovation .
and if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to ease their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US State of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are needed mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is meti@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move in international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ rons : &quot; it looks like I am more powerful than companies with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my opponents will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition , with which you can make it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; global feedback
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is launching an open @-@ source seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . thus , it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to the Member States governments to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &apos; Open Source &apos; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange them and to contribute to seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that soon more people will see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional and ecological food movement has especially taken care of where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) docum@@ enting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , in spite of this attack and the der@@ ail@@ ment of the Egyptian law and the constitution . it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals , so it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web @-@ side barriers to victims fell victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ O@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he writes in Egypt &apos;s un@@ appro@@ achable web pages and media .
now the blog he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which is also home to Zi@@ Canada &apos;s blog , is on the other hand accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video of how police exercise physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada spoke to the government and reflected what it means to him :
blocking blo@@ gs is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ Sis@@ i ; and even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs , and any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , albeit only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to b@@ ypass cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brave go the way up to the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 pages from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the locking of providers , through the b@@ ypass of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can prec@@ ede judgment against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kills 14 @-@ year @-@ old &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves smoke pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , Navy and air lake to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a stra@@ ined financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio in 2017 .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she announced , set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , which devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what is only happening in Rio , is published in the &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police that only shoots and then questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it profits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Petro@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

to design@@ ate Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data .
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for years .
one of these security measures was the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police offer and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has been increasingly bombar@@ ded after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week ago , the police cleared up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also caused head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where a chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the Assad regime &apos;s massacre was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , which led residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points to be smu@@ g@@ gled .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food products such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large portions of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to raise funds for the initiative , we use the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage locally produced prop@@ ell@@ ants are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fungi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from regions before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fungi all over in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two persons died and 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government calling for a state shower from solidarity with the victims for 3 days last week .
fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ ici@@ a region in Spain , where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017 , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some Twitter users shared images :
this is Bra@@ ga today night . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was to call for better preventive and anti @-@ fire measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ ia from the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o there were roads and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected to by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government carried out a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood spread , as in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
in addition to these issues , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt to use its own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial that the server did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million visitors .

two years earlier , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government had become a land of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say that back then , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
at dawn , the boy was supposed to break open .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers .

some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags of mortar which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
at the time , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings quot@@ as . it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres , &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also shar@@ pen .
but his stub@@ born wil@@ der helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions very soon .
after spending several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put all his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast track .
A@@ shar@@ af &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ an @-@ owned companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants have been created .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s objectives go far beyond the Italian restaurant and retail outlets and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also creates plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conversion techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ a made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; citizen report : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violations of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , have been in jail for more than 900 days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reported on the evi@@ ction of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that stipul@@ ates that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the payment of a penalty .
the law , which was adverti@@ sed by sixty members of the EP , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which harder pun@@ ish@@ ments would be imposed for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law the insul@@ t of the president and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . however , under the bill of law , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a legal date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused to prison in the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on false charges including weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si meeting block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
tune from Tunisi@@ an activists to peer @-@ reviewed documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that all returned funds returned .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 th@@ rows light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the designation of his sources stating that Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , in the district court in Tunis on the 9th of May , he appeared as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be achieved . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in We@@ Chat ?
not in Russia !
in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ am@@ nad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of information broad@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently owned by websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court has block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to subsidi@@ se a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
once this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install malware programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior .
