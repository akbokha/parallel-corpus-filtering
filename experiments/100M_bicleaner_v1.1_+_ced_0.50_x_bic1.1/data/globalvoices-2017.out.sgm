<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would live there for the first time now.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">When I was 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the upper federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free for Method Man," "" "I was, as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never thinks of the mountain as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted in favor with him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican primaries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which records people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpet Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles with the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act and think differently in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is hard to forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look differently from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (O.B.: white against all other ethnic groups; white and whiplash play on white and whiplash, which means as much as whiplash trauma) as the great Van Jones called, killed exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its President, twice the son of an Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trump, however, a huge portion of the white America has this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to remember Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier killed in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now rush country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instrument Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca and the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura have in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a few years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which, together with their musical instruments, has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and banc violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and playing in the bustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, timberhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga to play.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under the supervision of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a trash produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Mülllandfill) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic fills the orchestra with its inspiring performance of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even performed his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already been fishing illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law criminal this way to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comorators, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to port one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the region's waters: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia for looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crisscrosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had expelled the prime minister from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate contempt of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fisheries can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while action against illegal fishing was hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, which circulated information among individual countries, the actions today are happening in real time, trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noted or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pays attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to label ships fishing in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its captured fish on its way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can indicate whether the participating boats have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly also if they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay the punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD on lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters every year.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasy, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "specifically, they exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say 'You may not run my harbor'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 tests of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It uncovered criminal networks that had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst of Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different information levels. it aims to help FISH-i find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform jointly with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours, to get a better picture of who is doing what is - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to investigate." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project where a global system allows the pursuit of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and barely reckoned with consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats buy more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries joined together in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting the illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i.. "security is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the go without a license and were used towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans really works in the entire ocean.

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are protesting against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's presidency.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's request for a referendum, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis were going into emptiness, gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations can be found as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central north of the federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but in the end the secrecy of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on the impeachment of many is considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The election alliance, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática, or a short MUD (for example: round Table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, the demonstrators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>
<seg id="167">More information! pic.twitter.com / 9zyVGldNry</seg>

<seg id="170">"" "the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme" "" "Recreconquest of Venezuela" "" "took place on Wednesday, 26 October." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify, among other things, an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also disputes with policemen as well as advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently shared images shows a protesters calling through the shields: "will you kill me, because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that tell about confrontations, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves broke the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony from the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean state Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise one could see something that many national Guests do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round that sets the scale of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an impeachment procedure - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which, from their point of view, has undertaken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptation of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was audited on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in Córdoba, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera process in Córdoba province.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmerie officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixjanos's son, a man who over the years recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>

<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have become friends with one of the ERP systems.</seg>
<seg id="221">Don't be surprised if you don't kidnap you someday and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">"" "he told me that I would be" "" "secret" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok. for so my father had brought me up.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">"there the prisoners are tortured."</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla, all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he told me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything was possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and told me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the person's body which was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They unleashed a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it on with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The smell there was terrible... like a dirty windle.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that one person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'i knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and became eyebrows.</seg>
<seg id="250">He talked to "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the vicinity of the entrance, people kept quiet on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"" "when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "" "Why do you look so, asshole?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "I replied," "" "Why did you get me elsewhere?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit, killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">In addition to La Cuadra were some rooms that were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">"" "I know that" "" "Palito" "" "Romero put together a man there and killed." ""</seg>
<seg id="260">According to the survivors Jorge Romero, who was also accused at La Perla-Ribera's trial, accused the students of Raul Mateo Molina.</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video Emilio Fessia, director of the La Perla Memorial, runs through the former torture chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The path on which you came here is also the path on which the abductions came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">When you look at the map, you see that they took about this way and then were tortured for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be relocated.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The "booty of war"</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought home all sorts of stolen things.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was in the military later, - I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet or perhaps military junks that are taken away from an enemy that has been fought.</seg>

<seg id="273">But when one goes into a house and steals the fridge, the record player, clothes, paintings, money... then that is not booty but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always asked myself how my father, the leader of the security forces, was able to participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"" "once he called me a criminal and I said," "" "And you, who steal cars on the street?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You're not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded with rage, hit me and screamed:</seg>
<seg id="282">"" "" "" "if you go so far, then I will find you and kill yourself." ""</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">As I said in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a roller collar of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the body is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now that I am older, I feel remorse.</seg>

<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have executed people during the dictatorship, but why leave the bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidding children?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl back home, whose mother had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have simply put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but why leave their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families that could be passed over to their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that man can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when the democracy was reintroduced, they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." "" "you'll never find anything," "" "said my father." ""</seg>

<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I even participated in the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to experience for him.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong his driving license, witnesses to a very unsuccessful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word (koreilingsha), which means "older drivers," was falsely - but perhaps also with a vicious hind - and # 8212; translated as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the English translation was first removed. the designation" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the correct, although grammatically correct designation" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The prefecture of Kyoto apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate correction (the translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by senior citizens has risen during the same period.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the original text and to translate active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to translate translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, tasting or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees, leave translations in a company-internal manner. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and enigmatic phrases that arise by machine translation show that this technique can still not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewelry. but from major companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship measures on the internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar to Libertad" (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the Executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection had been snapped and advised users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to gain access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censor: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as vivoplay are popular among Venezolans with internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in reporting about protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission looked at this as a "appeal to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEITIOL later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transmits its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS servers respond incorrectly to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server responds erroneously or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third channel closed, the transfer was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay many girls become slaves to receive a training</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a child of a criadita as a child. now she visits the house in which she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies from other criaditas, which were just as victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use with kind permission of structural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the abridged version of a report published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows, decaying schools") edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house once more and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "That is what has become of this." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a criadier for the family. as criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a large family with little money hands over her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over her head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to pay innumerable days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Cridiazgo is widespread in Paraguay as a result of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Critical - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadago - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced them.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated on the crickets guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadago is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl with her and justifies exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadago</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the previously relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent impacts. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Critical in the household of the former military family Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 residents located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadier.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practice of Cridiazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadacgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest in protest and called for "no further Carolina" to be in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," lamented Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded rapid examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Critical.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be groundbreaking - for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo comes to trial.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Critical</seg>
<seg id="455">The criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to sign up and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They went all further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a criadier to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, on Fridays, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="475">In the school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and the harassment exposed to crickets when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadier.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to come home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video axes and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should be able to impose registration on users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working on protecting the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of the leopards, who roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of Leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "The Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team therefore states in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera body, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife in wildlife and educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the north-east of Japan, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the life of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a variety of prefectures in Japan's Northeast which experienced both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already alone for this reason, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahou Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, which progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing facility in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of planned spare parts were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the disaster, evacuation of keshift shelters (also forced to relocate casetsu juchaku) to the final replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in these dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the people who evacuated Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, this figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung was able to identify, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident suffered large-scale agriculture in the three prefectures of the agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but here too Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants make it harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper published numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she asked her about the status of the reconstruction and also how their feeling has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahou Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken steps to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper increasingly focused on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuated people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In early 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled in permanent surrounde houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017, still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima can compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Kriconi talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she has collected with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer during a demonstration in Goiana beat him against his head.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the German University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">The pictures show the police officer's face, attacking a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiana with his stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralzador," a media activist from Goiana, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which it is seen how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video, filmed with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family who lives in another state, Internet users have meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular Gregorio Arleé Mañalich church, located in the western Cuban province of Mayanque, is commonly known as the Central Central - at Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no real crop of sugar on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After grounding the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the steel and concrete structure remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which are still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is rising every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in use after a long inactive period because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production totalled 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and barely competitive, they were unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">But the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos a pound, according to the report "Agricultural Policy" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "said the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on began the restructuring process in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeated the most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same thing: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">Officially written documents were distinguished only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factory which was still in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he removed one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important counterparts producer was wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were.</seg>
<seg id="670">We will never know if during the Mammut speech of 21 October 2002, the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons, when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years, everything would run well.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane factory closed, or better said than they began to dismantle it, they also stopped raising the road, this also disadvantaged other farms.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip-hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Capturing a song from "Home to Me" - The Gray Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission from N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders from 2014 have direct access to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the Winnebago strain in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in West Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not always native to the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation picked up, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and go ahead with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary piece, the reader and champion of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and inserts the verse in syllabi (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin santou (the "plastic models of the dishes") are exhibited by any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the towering district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend transforms them today into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver matome, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin gently.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone tapes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyo department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into tacky items, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food completions is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an emperor-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own work of art. in this case, icura and salmon are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon booths?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow Twitter the hashtag #, but also in # Hashtag.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these mirrors do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, Chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trade"), to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who have been involved in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Change") narrates these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for hidden graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews only a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves for the task we have asked ourselves to go and look for graves after the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a woman of animal político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Her contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about "heroism" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the violence of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by being" "" "soaked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not agitated and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been robbed with threats," she describes how armed criminals squeezed money out of her business month for month, until in the end they destroyed not only the business but also tore down her family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain over it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will deceive or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the verge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, keep tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, who saw the bloody murder of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 cups a day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by the Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNMENT: this contribution and the pages to which he links contain images depicting violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factor check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting on events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker trolley crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were scorned.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das ist Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">There are numbers of charred bodies strung on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was put up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses were in the streets and in the bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count bodies," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been cut, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by means of satellite images the follow-up period could be displayed metaphorically.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from DR Congo, when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented ordinances to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange was also associated with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who escaped were able to flee blows, rape and many dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news site, which falsely claimed that Myanmar's president Than had said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students, who had been killed by the Boko Haram, released from the news page Análisis Digital, which is now deleted, has expressly stated that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims it represents a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was subsequently circulated in connection with the Boko Haram massacre in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">"" "Turkey, 2015." "" "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" "" "(Nigeria burns, the world sleeps)." ""</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, with this Twitterhashtag, appeared and sparked a discussion among Muslims after the massacres of Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that allegedly took place on behalf of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times) but the messages related to it have not been taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message circulated by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, discussion forums such as this were translated into Vietnamese and declared it false.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included, the organization of the Clarettin Missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos dissociated.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are other confirmed examples of faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">On other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the portfolio in Gray), Tintin also points, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture might ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that permeate these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence related to the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media there are tens of people who unintentionally do share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this sentiment of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and bellows the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has been debated extensively (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images are desensitized readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world, which are difficult or at all not to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Acid) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all resist every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's VAT, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Take care of your parents in recognizing the way around you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after getting warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite subjects here.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They were oblivious to me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1016">As Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was a Muslim Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western conception, the religion of Rumi was deleted, as did the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative is failing to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this, consciously and unconsciously, to solidify the "other," as my girlfriend and I present in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupying that we have no president, the chocolate cake is feeding, while he already spends broken countries and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now, despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling Initiative (TLS), is telling stories in their original language a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices told recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where people don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is often associated with understanding" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to, to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation make it possible for the audience to focus on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion, as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical of her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fabel, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story narrative.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for re-establishment of public debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">On 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration with the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico. the march started at the capital of the capital, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deutería de la Deuda" (Citizens front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">Puerto Rico's people demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is held in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Afterresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here license-free contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge, and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the list of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have not received any information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken on the basis of a command of the Military Tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people who imagined herself as insiders of the Assad government and informed them about an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Man, a designer, technologist, and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project founded in Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more provisionally than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilisations, and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural inheritance of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel did not finish this project until now.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proclamation that she wrote to her husband in 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians have been incarcerated under the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: sentenced to prison on account of corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to corruption in which a government member resigned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced in 2010 together with four other defendants for embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds at the airports of Mozambique, whose council was presided over by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released for good leadership in 2016 and immediately called for reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which issued an application, there would be no grounds for Cambaza to re-enter its former position, as the company did not conduct any disciplinary proceedings following its detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that also the company should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and made no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "conflicting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivate speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Quite disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, a young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil say that the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that he had insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality to return to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state to act as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeuste prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves are part of the Samora Mahel prison that Mozambique will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, incisive, and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was, when he confirmed vigorously that "an ambitious man was capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said, "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious person is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment; he was sitting for 10 years and was free.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, in which he misses money, is under contract again. # AssimVaiOMeuPais - яαλίς) May 12, 2017</seg>
<seg id="1284">Emildo Sambo of the magazine @ Verdade (too dt.: @ truth) states that criminality is paying off in Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1285">In fact, in # Mozambique thief and servant of the # Frelimo, it pays off. # Diodino Cambaza, sentenced to long possible imprisonment, returns to # Airports of Mozambique - Emildo Sambo (@ EmildoSambo) May 11, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took over their posts from the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "Kalar" "" "(Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important and # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the Word or expressed doubt in order to use it were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burmesan words with different meanings having the same sequence of letters as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmesan also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spalter bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase" "" "ku la -" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook had to be more analytic before all the posts that were suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to Facbehook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age brackets).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate language, get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was "not consistent with the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intent or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hate within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and prohibited words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their posts are removed from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook has been criticized for its failure to control hateful hate speech on its Burma sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on context than on code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Turkish users can revisit Wikipedia content by mirroring web pages</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page, which is English-speaking, was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular encyclopedia Wikipedia based on crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and TV-series fans defend themselves against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using circumventing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world) most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, there are regular blockings of the Internet since 2007 after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the world's best-known country when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computers) which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is still available despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we put everything in store snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was performed independently from the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia had been involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors, when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported to Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses to another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A Suhlender Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he looked around around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and selected colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first class position helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just sitting at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other river side where the Leopard was in and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain international recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he had already seen tigers face to face with face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzzword appeared. he sat down immediately, we looked at us and he stared me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could shoot a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid women with the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that because of their social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a false court from the Indian state of Odisha and infringed by her family and the village community after having addressed a secret relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition not to call their wives by their names is also common among men. however, they have far fewer responsibilities to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe, in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one out of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelminal which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Payer has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who do not call their husbands by their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak out loud the names of their husbands is a custom which they all keep up with guilt and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name, wanted to try at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him now by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started his first discussion club with this confidence in his luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she said," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "shouldn't it be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands to the lips," says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking up a century-old tradition in which married women should never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only chuckled in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline to have broken with an age old custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband's husband was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not ceased altogether, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry, who could hear something," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives, they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our ties to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have had only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of one's own dress code, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini adorned her own pair of curtas (upper-shirts) into a discussion lap so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion evening, Rohini confirms that things are getting rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling over more freedom of movement or the own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cult band's music is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (endangering state), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to the case as an" "" "internal issue" "" "and a speaker says that he considers it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to release calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, Dichterin Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have fully wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should put pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden have refused to answer questions about the release of Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the trip to China, as exports had largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top-ranking diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Liu as she announced in an announcement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are meant to meet and receive all visits they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June that the embassy afforded the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's request drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim to comply with Chinese constitutional law and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin that Liu "gets all the medical support he needs and that a" humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was issued on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported the Reuters news agency that China had major concerns whether the fuss surrounding Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to be cared for by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's attorney told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to anyone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow those rights to be enforced for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where, and in addition, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will finally accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called upon China to allow the ill intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been strictly punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting during a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the single political party of Singapore, because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one ceases to say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre pops up from the authoritarian rulers, pretending to be democrats, abandons the twisted logic, since it is better suited to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam the answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned such questions in a rational way with non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng is calling on Shanmugam to make clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out that one should start reading the entire message of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes he is correctly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks down the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "benign a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook internally from anger, if they are kept for Americans but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know what to do, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians can attach a Canadian flag to their rucksack when they travel.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is headed by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink goose-frame and gold-colored earrings in Teddy Bears-Form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the storeroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells, the people come in full-sized busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">Currently it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children there.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp of Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived previously in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a blind alley to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are too expensive to sell.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar a night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is everything again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers regularly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves with numerous photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats each time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-in point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users is scheduled to close by the site</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are forced to install spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile user in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "the message is said to prevent the app from" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities did not use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the children's filters for minors, is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Of course, an app with these features can be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" ("images from mainland China"), published by censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the residents randomly to check if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of bondage by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(" "" "Image from mainland China" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description showing that the software can lift the license request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated organisations, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, a US human rights organisation, also referred to these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" in the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished without being punished, even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">In punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to give me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "he calls the affectionate" "" "confession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube, which probably comes from the cloaca.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner delights in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you can't measure yourself with him and you can't hold back your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked as a waste collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated, while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner remarked the cooling and did not find any pleasure in it, which is why he resorted to an electrically charged rod.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed up my whole body enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half naked body, stretched out on the floor, was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness vanished and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two awful hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to go to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed, which seemed to me like minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he looms to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the topmost floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as fellows (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its established views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as oriental, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that extend from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he harbors a special aversion to U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee from the second generation" - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine yet.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he poured in water-dissolved Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot June day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the smeliness of lukewarm coffee and the cockroaches of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert "just" had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that question the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who still chose to use "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply a shallow rhetoric, but actually reflected in a more and more clear-reaching reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to Leibe's traditional sex organs by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years the number of 'honours' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial ones left unofficial.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime fighting from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be detained in prison indefinitely," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music is also very popular and is well known for not shy away from issues that are long considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was fed up with politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward Sa'ed" "", "Hdaib examines the question of Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse often repeats:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one, in his words, can "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to remember that his comments were ripped out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib advertises for the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems today.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuis, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new any more that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, stating that they were critical in social media commentaries on the problems related to corruption that were deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature from genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial nature. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing were taken over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of western Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">For a long time I look at the Meguro Forjoen: two fixed wagons are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breath-taking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18-meter-tall car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate job like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high rate of crime, where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of bad ratings a training in the hair art that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities to offer, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district to which we are very proud, because out of love for the children we built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerilla fighters," which has published the international online magazine Tea AfterTwelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel ejected to accomodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">It was precisely this question that the two young Colombian activists led Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogotá and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation no longer inspired them and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Mliación (letters to reconciliation), which encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace agreement was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas who have lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carried arms around the clock must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians must join together and help in the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureate, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former combatants of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i would never have thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotá Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very touching moment for all those involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," said political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I entered one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go there, because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I asked him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life has anyone written something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over my cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices heard</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leader joined a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already at war and the FARC already operated in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC stated the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state affects the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to making society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings that were turned upside by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms, stand up and protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, to a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to elevate themselves above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that address the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta, throwing a light on the methods of Chechen authorities that arrested suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grosny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Since childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">As she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens experienced the gender equality of their land wife, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">For fear of her life, she went to the US in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I have been working as a volunteer for a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can remove this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents went round by WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had heard everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC media: in which cases were you laid - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor knew and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said that I had to prove it by running through the streets above without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with darkened windows and a plate plate with a 95 on it stood.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time, it became clear to me that there was a little lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends tested the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to disclose their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without passport, without knowing everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "don't you think you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you put in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this emotional barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually try to look at how the person looks at the person she recalled from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have remained dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had settled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan was hard to wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so-called "glory" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to surrender to Cadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately dipped in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison are gone after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was there himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about this yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny when I was still there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to approach us originally to" "" "Civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked out; I had tinted eyelashes, wearing reddish jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never hurt me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they laugh at the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov came to the map.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed beforehand, looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic grew steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you take now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea lists, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clapped the variety of cures.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam before the mouth, that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dageants have which, the Kabardines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you change your sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, in order to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know I'm now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwa community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestral region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwa region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, such as Ahwa's human rights groups who would like to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video posted on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwa.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ahrazi Minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month, several others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazazwi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have met.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patrons who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large majority of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwa was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwa region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable arable land for Iranian farming.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahtiwazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate devastation caused by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fishing and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among Arab ahawks has increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis who are looking for a job, graduating from primary school, finished 55% of secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Doshii, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the settling process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Because functionaries and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their native country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahrazi, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women, especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists, respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women today still earn less money than men despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still traversing across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I bond twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I get to speak on skin color, on racism, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we've always been abused under racial segregation and discrimination, in both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices up and" sing Kumbaya, my Lord "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualized violence in an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence that we face black women in a twofold way.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement as black women, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which relate both to the sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised being in a historical way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "I refuse to join groups, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to drive forward their egocentric programme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlap of skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming itself (for example: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves), we can also create spaces where they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalization after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abridged and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">As another woman Balbuena displayed because of mistreatment, the advertised ad of Ada Báez did not benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her message.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">They generally do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 Strikes and Statical 2 Invisible maltreatment and a legal system, which is nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General issued 9600 notifications of domestic violence. 70% of these cases were used for violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts. here too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">"" "" "" "however, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman who wants to report to Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this will come to any woman who has suffered from physical abuse," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm girlfriend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this was to be regretted forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer has Carlos together. but for two years she has endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically if he ever lifted the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had dropped from Carlos so long and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not born in Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in some way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorian's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, known under the hashtag # Porelas (# Elecsys).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that feminid must be declared a criminal offence and punish harsher as is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill envisaged the majority of (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must carry on their own if they simply want to report and obtain a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates itself and contributes to the fact that the offenders get away punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to report such a long time until mistreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the bill was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage that caused the partners in cases of domestic violence to be reconciled.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The passage concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons why there are two reasons for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investments in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists will help build own research capacities in Africa. a major role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for the Research of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS Epidemic pointed out the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Sámi healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Varrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sámi national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receiver, rather than being a mover.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools in order to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can make articles accessible only against payment (the so-called "paywall"), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change world food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited by its own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce can be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents were not only for individual types but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereals or cartons. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a thousand-year-old tradition, Morton continues to grow salad, but it takes longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder around which I have to commute." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed a new variety of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "he makes as good as possible and tries to breed the traits he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and around the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Römersalat of Outbreak Gorgeous in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement originates from the IT field and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open-source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders may oblige that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell them. "open source" breeders merely allow others who buy their seeds, cross it to grow their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy views</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Consequently seed plays a role in greater coherence such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "if you want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as is offered on farmers markets, you should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others. thus, their approach is to be patented in contrast to seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool unceasingly shrinks due to increasing intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore becoming more limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetically variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartel features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available to other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat can be patented in an even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves, through which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-speaking Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property affects other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other way: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires will certainly not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to ease their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US State of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are needed mass herbicides, bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is meticulous." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move in international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject the patenting or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patrons: "it looks like I am more powerful than companies with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my opponents will sell my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected for 20 years before competition, with which you can make it quite easy in my opinion. "global feedback</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is launching an open-source seed program.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented. thus, it contradicts the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now up to the Member States governments to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's' Open Source 'seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch is scheduled next year.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) documenting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true to its goal of defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, in spite of this attack and the derailment of the Egyptian law and the constitution. it has never been so difficult to continue to pursue these goals, so it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web-side barriers to victims fell victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmODS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles, which he writes in Egypt's unapproachable web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which is also home to ZiCanada's blog, is on the other hand accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, as he reported on the student protests and recorded a video of how police exercise physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada spoke to the government and reflected what it means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking blogs is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs, and any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to bypass censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">"" "" "" "the brave go the way up to the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 pages from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the locking of providers, through the bypass of Internet censorship and private surfing possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can precede judgment against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "" "kills 14-year-old" "", "" "" "thieves smoke pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, Navy and air lake to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "which she announced, set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., which deviates from the civilized standard and what is only happening in Rio, is published in the "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police that only shoots and then questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it profits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Petroveira, on the other hand, argues against the violence as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"" "" "" "this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as has been demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of the public service." ""</seg>

<seg id="2777">To designate Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murder rates per federal state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security measures was the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a Favela by deploying a massive police offer and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP has been increasingly bombarded after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not consistent with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also caused headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly through the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where a chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume that the Assad regime's massacre was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, which led residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points to be smuggled.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food products such as meat have become unattainable for large portions of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage locally produced propellants are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "production of fungi" "" "from regions before verifying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal last week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government calling for a state shower from solidarity with the victims for 3 days last week.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires have also been registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone in 2017, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in four districts.</seg>

<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to contain the scale of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveria from the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão there were roads and villages for everything and nothing evacuated.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "in the forest of Leiria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were closed very late." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected to by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government carried out a slackening of the law, which allowed construction activity to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article in the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood spread, as in a vicious circle, after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these issues, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used fogos.pt to use its own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the server did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to people in need twice a day.</seg>

<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 "special reception centres," which are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unimaginable personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also sharpen.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his stubborn wilder helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions very soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years in the construction industry, Asharaf put all his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast track.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, a number of Afghan-owned companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants have been created.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Oriental Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs's objectives go far beyond the Italian restaurant and retail outlets and aim back to the country he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also creates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conversion techniques. "thus, they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashara made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>

<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty members of the EP, is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which harder punishments would be imposed for the insult of the president or a senior official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law the insult of the president and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the bill of law, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protesters who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in jail for a legal date." ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused to prison in the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree on false charges including weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi meeting blockade on Raba'a Al-Adaviya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tune from Tunisian activists to peer-reviewed documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that all returned funds returned.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21 throws light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the designation of his sources stating that Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, in the district court in Tunis on the 9th of May, he appeared as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks is to be achieved. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in WeChat?</seg>

<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
