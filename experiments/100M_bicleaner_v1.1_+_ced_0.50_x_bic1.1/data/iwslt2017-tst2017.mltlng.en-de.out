this is James Ris@@ en .
they may know him because he won the Pu@@ li@@ tzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly published that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally owned phones from Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation where the CIA had literally brid@@ ged Iran &apos;s blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has investigated the crack and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the first constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked in tears , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had years of information that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of spl@@ inter@@ ing and split@@ ting cracks , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have kept his telephone number secret secretly ,
as well as his email data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey ster@@ ling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condem@@ ns more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional review , because the government has more and more ways to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows governments to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do it right from the moment they are in touch , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that didn &apos;t exist yet when ris@@ king had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect media freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology developers such as Edward Snow@@ den have the opportunity to show mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in supplying soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental researcher who suggests the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
at least , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens have hidden . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ sack and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
it sounds like the plot of an agency or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these disclos@@ ures are phenom@@ enal .
around the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and hide their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the US .
probably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these disclos@@ ures .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , give less information to set up a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all of this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring a susp@@ icious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we were really shocked by the fact that all of us responded to a lawyer to our investig@@ ators how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as isolated cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has registered in central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls it .
one of the un@@ fortunate facts is that the US is behind .
representatives of both parties introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my studies , I went for sale .
one guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
then I heard : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what was I rock@@ in here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the tips of the toes and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my angle of view .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood , actually friends who only waited to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal to me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear in fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ w@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create tremendous confidence by design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting person .
this quiet touch of panic you are feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the locked mobile of a stranger in his hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
most guests also feel if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like this , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone ?
could you tell us on Twitter that he is going to be a candidate for the President &apos;s office ?
you can now return the phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ? if he had told him where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine that you had 150 assessments , all of which say , &quot; He can really hold on very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest gave their ratings before we set them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
little surprisingly we trust people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stands out in common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one gives price .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , for example &quot; Great works of art in your home ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can it be created with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t reck@@ on was the large amount of people who were more than willing to remove these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a requirement that had not been met before .
business is running very well for us .
of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were not allowed to party parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stop in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I only think about it .
the disappointment that was heard in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , a fraction of the total overnight stays had only one fraction of a problem .
people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , miracles can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angels , who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will run off .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place one visits , a group of residents would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub lic neighborhood of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , overnight 7@@ 8@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by foreigners or even hosts over our platform alone .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work really work ?
apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker ,
and I &apos;m a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my he@@ address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying in buildings , people jumped from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... ... , ... &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... , ... &quot; We bom@@ bed Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me from a citizen into a susp@@ icious one .
the same day we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I sat in silence -- as deep as I went down into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were believed to be Muslims .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I don &apos;t have any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it may stop a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths , and to show larger civi@@ c participation .
and as a director of the police in Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , one has found out that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may turn into bra@@ in@@ washing causing the terrorists to be the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
a prominent ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her silence and told her that their anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m recre@@ ated the connection with God and its church .
instead of bl@@ aming her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned at the mos@@ que guard her to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- to show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , con@@ formity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if one sets out test persons reported negative about Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims fell upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when commit@@ ting collective guilt , it is not just about explaining yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided to go to the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed , and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than ours .
thank you so much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what to say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind@@ set , so an exception rather than the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want welfare for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is close to becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks live . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
connecting to each other allows flying machines to reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ tigh@@ tening structures .
they have learned to wear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be executed at the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
unlike most starter motors , it can float and has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying is working with only one .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically most remote @-@ controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the space everywhere .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I must throw it properly .
the likel@@ ihood of getting it right when all of you watch me is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in vig@@ il@@ ance , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight Prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way he gets the proper skill ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is represent@@ able in models , the rest is learned right when flying .
let &apos;s see that .
if flight machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if also limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ters -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technologies and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you so much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they gle@@ amed more bri@@ ghtly than all stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , a lot of cel@@ esti@@ al life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is on our side -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially bold -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ waves @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes were blowing through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , it was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched towards one direction and put into the other .
lec@@ turers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance in courses for the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even lu@@ dic@@ rous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and du@@ ped by us at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that is why the Lig@@ o staff was ins@@ ane .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to assert that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from multiple points around you .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that are of particular significance to you :
the face of your child is about .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice speaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple images of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampli@@ tude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are at the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like this : w@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ der noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what he must hear knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s just think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around a hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ c stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , as these are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own light shining .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sau@@ erk@@ raut bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o provides us with a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe &apos;s noise and chir@@ ping .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me to unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just do what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes , which changed my life pro@@ found@@ ly , to an unexpected degree . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guess I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from there on , I &apos;m always chat@@ ting with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , aw@@ aken to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every program offers hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars tv , four TV programmes , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four episodes : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing that ?
no one , therefore , I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as if you are wearing a high sound , you should run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is sum@@ ming up .
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started with the TV production when I began to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the tot@@ ality is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can &apos;t strive other than size .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you that I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more blur@@ red boundaries , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more hope there is .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the tot@@ als .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth , that their M@@ um is a single stit@@ job .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my M@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ stim@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ ing was silent .
I didn &apos;t like my work any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ ality did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours of rehear@@ sed weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l made you stupid , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you do , you love what you are doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and you know how the tot@@ ality feels when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become conscious of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz th@@ ru@@ sts , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go of in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door rises and an energy boost is coming in .
and not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the amount of work , the titanium frame , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how fully my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the false words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it &apos;s law , I have no choice . I don &apos;t have another choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t think to play as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , for what a human being rather works rather than being home ?
well , yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of that .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! tell them Yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably have right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and if my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the play , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no linen , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children make a bed .
but there are 15 minutes in it !
my children are my feel @-@ good , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I have a hard time and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the tot@@ ality of the work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fires burn still .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ mons . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the sums , the tot@@ es , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life becomes wider within me . less titanium - more I !
the more I feel like this , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day dealing with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ pl@@ uses an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation however does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to allow cells to grow from tissue play is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to make them thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François made it .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
you may even know from biology lessons that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly disper@@ sed and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear , however -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ reim@@ ported them at the capture site of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ op@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ ported .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ eing in vitro , in culture .
of course , we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they did that very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor area in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hands anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , we implant his own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same ape , two months after expl@@ ant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ate them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you so much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno notes : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study .
you must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is f@@ ading with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- might not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my native friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a false belief , could save us democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are m@@ um@@ ber@@ ed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , US dollars have been invested in the US , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ alized by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest .
in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my sh@@ arks with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more importantly and decisi@@ vely , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal weigh@@ ting in questions of the state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle that shines very bright , it is also burnt out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ ic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle was fought between the two by gradually under@@ mining the politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as in the past ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is emig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that has decim@@ ated the animals that feed them so sustain@@ ably that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has galvan@@ ized politics so far that it itself har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we need to re@@ unite the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good .
the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage labour@@ ers by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the wa@@ sting more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
we need to res@@ h@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve humans and people can bury their energy in the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical application , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a freely oscill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time a secretary in which she prefers privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an , because she will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rub@@ b@@ ish bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno notes : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liberal Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by trans@@ mitting this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very gre@@ ek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what we can see in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to acc@@ use China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells terri@@ bly for hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely saying goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continuous denial that a massive bra@@ cing line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continuing to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do it right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , continued to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ eau ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister who claims to be in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to overthrow our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been implementing a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
the majority have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel @-@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy doesn &apos;t have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows located at the right of this corner .
this curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is evaluated at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price isn &apos;t about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean cul@@ mination , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , do you attack , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again .
they collect millions of data to then decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 - i.e. something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team were working on .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , i.e. the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always generating the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google may make mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of the Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the success cul@@ minated in a release in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year after year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data is becoming increasingly important in decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people can uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , break down this problem into its parts , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable for putting the parts together again and then to come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to put pieces and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they belong in the process as well .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas , then choosing &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data starts to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there were data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will drive it out later with a technical demo .
so far I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened in hind@@ sight to the ball .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a bit more sophisticated ones , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
