<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly published that the NSA illegally owned phones from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation where the CIA had literally bridged Iran's blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has investigated the crack and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked in tears, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had years of information that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of splintering and splitting cracks, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have kept his telephone number secret secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">As well as his email data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary condemns more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional review, because the government has more and more ways to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows governments to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do it right from the moment they are in touch, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that didn't exist yet when risking had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect media freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology developers such as Edward Snowden have the opportunity to show misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in supplying soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental researcher who suggests the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money in tax havens have hidden.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Fonseca Mossack and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin about a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">It sounds like the plot of an agency or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these disclosures are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Around the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by a few to hide and hide their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these disclosures.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, give less information to set up a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all of this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 bar firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">We were really shocked by the fact that all of us responded to a lawyer to our investigators how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as isolated cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single leading politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was political attention given by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has registered in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unfortunate facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a draft bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my studies, I went for sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Well, how?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what was I rockin here?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at the tips of the toes and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my angle of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood, actually friends who only waited to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal to me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door was falling into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blewczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publish public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create tremendous confidence by design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting person.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you are feeling now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the locked mobile of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests also feel if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like this, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell us on Twitter that he is going to be a candidate for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name? if he had told him where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you had 150 assessments, all of which say, "He can really hold on very well-locked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest gave their ratings before we set them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stands out in common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one gives price.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother --" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, for example "Great works of art in your home! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can it be created with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't reckon was the large amount of people who were more than willing to remove these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a requirement that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to party parties or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stop in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts already when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that was heard in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, a fraction of the total overnight stays had only one fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">People trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, miracles can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will run off.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just a" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place one visits, a group of residents would be waiting to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub lic neighborhood of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, overnight 78,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by foreigners or even hosts over our platform alone.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work really work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet, it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness-fanatiker,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I'm a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headdress.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flying in buildings, people jumped from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists...,..." in the name of Islam......,... "" Jihad... "...,..." We bombed Mekka! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me from a citizen into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to go through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I sat in silence -- as deep as I went down into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations which said:" "" "be vigilant" "", "" "" "Be careful," "" "" "" "stay in well-lit areas," "" "don't be sampled." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>

<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>

<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I've got the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>

<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I don't have any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may stop a few parking spaces, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant towards people of other faiths, and to show larger civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a director of the police in Washington DC area recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, one has found out that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family so that the extremists may turn into brainwashing causing the terrorists to be the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">A prominent imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she had spoken brought her silence and told her that their anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam recreated the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned at the mosque guard her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- to show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if one sets out test persons reported negative about Muslims, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims fell upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When committing collective guilt, it is not just about explaining yourself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when did my brother become such an accomplished young man?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child seat, we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked, and welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion for panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than ours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what to say to those who might say that you hold a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble mindset, so an exception rather than the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the biggest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want welfare for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is close to becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1,500 bricks live. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting to each other allows flying machines to reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-tightening structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to wear loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the space.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be executed at the highest level. for example," "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starter motors, it can float and has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying is working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically most remote-controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move in the space everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to flying, I must throw it properly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of getting it right when all of you watch me is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the monospinner is an exercise in vigilance, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight Propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he gets the proper skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is representable in models, the rest is learned right when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flight machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong - a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopters -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technologies and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very distant galaxy, so they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they gleamed more brightly than all stars along in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not set them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, a lot of celestial life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is on our side -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially bold -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer-waves-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo could be increased significantly, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes were blowing through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves of black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched towards one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers often perform a really silly dance in courses for the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and stow, stretch and stow." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ludicrous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and duped by us at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that is why the Ligo staff was insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to assert that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from multiple points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that are of particular significance to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child is about.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice speaks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob breaks them down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dumb Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple images of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are at the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surrender noise] Someone who knows what he must hear knows this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate approximately as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's just think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereic stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the Big Bang is covered by its own light shining.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sauerkraut bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo provides us with a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the universe's noise and chirping.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say," "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me to unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just do what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes, which changed my life profoundly, to an unexpected degree. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "guesses" "" "for unexplainable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "guess I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from there on, I'm always chatting with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things out, awaken to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every program offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars tv, four TV programmes, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four episodes: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore, I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say: I understand that it's not about dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you are wearing a high sound, you should run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is summing up.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started with the TV production when I began to work and work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totality is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you can't strive other than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you that I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more blurred boundaries, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more hope there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the totals.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their Mum is a single stitjob.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my Mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Estimate, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzing was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't like my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totality did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours of rehearsed weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showpiece titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fading the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul made you stupid, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you do, you love what you are doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and you know how the totality feels when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become conscious of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one to" "" "estimate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz thrusts, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, loneliness and lack of buzz, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon that I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is letting go of in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door rises and an energy boost is coming in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the amount of work, the titanium frame, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV-hours and how fully my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the false words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can rid myself of any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no choice. I don't have another choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't think to play as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, for what a human being rather works rather than being home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of that.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! tell them Yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably have right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teenage daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the play, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no linen, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children make a bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But there are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feel-good, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what's good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I have a hard time and I win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The totality of the work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowing to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfires burn still.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the summons. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the high tone, the sums, the totes, the other, the right sums: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life becomes wider within me. less titanium - more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel like this, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things out, I awaken you to life.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day dealing with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who is trying to improve the nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one impluses an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons' circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation however does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that skull-brain traumas swells the brain and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To allow cells to grow from tissue play is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to make them thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François made it.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">You may even know from biology lessons that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly dispersed and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-reimported them at the capture site of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autopransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimplantate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyeing in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course, we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor area in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hands anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implant his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same ape, two months after explantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implantiate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno notes: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you need to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first truly prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is fading with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- might not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my native friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a false belief, could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are mumbered, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, US dollars have been invested in the US, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railway tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock exchanges and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equalized by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance particularly all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the significance of the athic democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the athic democracy was and is that it involved the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and decisively, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal weighting in questions of the state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also burnt out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athic democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle was fought between the two by gradually undermining the politics and disempowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as in the past?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that has decimated the animals that feed them so sustainably that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has galvanized politics so far that it itself harms itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we need to reunite the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage labourers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the wasting more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We need to reshape the economy and reunite the sectors of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end in a pathological hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," similar to the "Star Trek," in which machines serve humans and people can bury their energy in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the" "" "Matrix" "" "-like dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical application, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a freely oscillating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a secretary in which she prefers privileged individuals, and Marxian, because she will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the rubbish bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno notes: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transmitting this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economics -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say this provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To accuse China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells terribly for hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely saying goodbye to complacency and the continuous denial that a massive bracing line passed through the eurozone, and continuing to massively threaten the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "to do it right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, continued to choose denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernstheau...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance or any minister who claims to be in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I thought that there was an honest interest in the lenders' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to overthrow our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been implementing a disastrous programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1038">The majority have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igel-hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the contents that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy doesn't have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows located at the right of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad", "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price isn't about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean culmination, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and chooses eight TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, do you attack, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skipping or watching again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to then decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 - i.e. something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewer, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening, because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google may make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, by data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "the success culminated in a release in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year after year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data is becoming increasingly important in decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized a few patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, break down this problem into its parts, so that you can analyse the items; as a second, put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable for putting the parts together again and then to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to put pieces and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they belong in the process as well.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like "House of Cards" did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first when competing for TV ideas, then choosing "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that's what the data tell us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data starts to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will drive it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I've made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened in hindsight to the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with a bit more sophisticated ones, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball is smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
