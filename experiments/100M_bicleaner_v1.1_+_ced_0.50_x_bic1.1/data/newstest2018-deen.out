Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a mine chapel , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich presents exciting stories for days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the car @-@ na@@ vi showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavarian At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but especially informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and congreg@@ ations in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ rul@@ sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
according to the Bavarian Authority of Sur@@ veying , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from Bavaria &apos;s first surveys .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
although the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph moved the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates from 18@@ 56 and can be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of earlier / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered hall@@ marks from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; from which the land tax was deduc@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small par@@ c@@ els now occupy no more farmers - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green space distingu@@ ishes itself north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October Festival since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete buildings .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the rise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was established there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the buying of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he forbi@@ ds staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients it was first place , later it was expanded to 500 seats .
at some point this capacity did not suff@@ ice - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k ren@@ own in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , is located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now facing the area of the former Warsaw prison .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the soccer field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where this day was the preliminary work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn will take place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schie@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil Rights group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association to Support Far@@ mer has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i request special attention and caution when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , rac@@ ist @-@ based incidents occur in the whole state recently and here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discri@@ min@@ atory complaints , as well as the authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , prompted the group to publish travel warnings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ enses against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office , showing that black drivers in the state are reported to be 75 percent more common than white ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have to be ready if they want to bring a deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , which classi@@ fy the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th ranks of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws , obli@@ ging local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration off@@ ences , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view to further profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project is a successful project and will be continued next year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
at the pi@@ v@@ ot gra@@ vey@@ ard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insight into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ able way for the milk of his cows , according to Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales can be found on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the president of B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot manage profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area ensures a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he had no organic farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader &apos;s advancement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the promotion , farmers often stand in the criticism
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced in 2013 via the electric fence .
the area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ en@@ listed until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women , it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Ord@@ in@@ ance ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state subsidies for pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
moreover , the area to be f@@ enced may not be tractor @-@ resistant ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ bacher Christmas fence project 2018 , the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which want to build a fence about 16 kilometres , is currently being applied .
the area of conservation is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to drastically limit the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller gra@@ bbed not the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ at@@ owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done so .
but he assumed its importance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to deal here with a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem that you refer to , which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he put it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your afflicted masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the miserable garbage of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a classic exemplary fashion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus had changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anybody , but rather an early neo@@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is going on .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the deck of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Team of Great Britain
the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent will make a massive contribution to the team in the world cup loader . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue to do it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ t - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen as team captain by the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , competing with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ sman are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the centre aisle runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that one should observe after a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
the team captain says that she is &quot; very proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but in some cases also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics over Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from the domestic policy to his political principles .
he did not hesitate to critic@@ ise him .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of that at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s headquarters dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ free head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore blocking people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is referred to as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans MEP , A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people shooting online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just genuine people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not profound .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I polit@@ ely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor posted as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mile@@ stones on this issue was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County defeated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recor@@ ders suggested his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , were overwhel@@ med by his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he established this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura open since it was taken out of the program in the year after winning it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Master Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
domestic connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are more or less in time , &quot; said the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction works , represents a big problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the troubled Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the woo@@ ded tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she doesn &apos;t have any furniture - where she performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a can@@ opy room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the Dutch rule for independence , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assing the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corru@@ gated roofs that have been converted by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Mountain , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined at 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua related to wood resources in the value of estimated US $ 78 billion .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ jan demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to the activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tribal land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970 &quot; s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Are G@@ elling Every@@ thing &quot; in a report by the Or@@ e dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents occur , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bolts have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources lead to an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim business immigrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung can@@ te@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ hang , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of rights in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ os@@ i , expecting us to fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the shocked children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an attack on their tone and later returned to four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was ign@@ ited and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - constantly and a bird @-@ song im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to hur@@ l stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his bri@@ ghtly painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ esh , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman of the Papua New Police Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings only came on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ho@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then An@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , charged by the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanded more than 1,000 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independent vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with gri@@ m in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother , Y@@ ac@@ obus , repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a b@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , who was 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ g , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ ili@@ tary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ content of the members of the family Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , living in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State of Papua ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of range .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or skills needed to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua related institutions for lack of coordination , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ os@@ is &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s most troubled Kenya provinces : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
the spokesman for the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s alle@@ gations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also took part in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ovo again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to know that Jok@@ ho@@ v@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being living under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the victim &apos;s body was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they will never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that takes place in only two years through the high @-@ rise building , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we woke up with the fire alarm and when the people cry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooling down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two winning sets is not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these are often very long , but even so highly valued five @-@ set classics are therefore retained for the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only narrow@@ ly missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many claims , the proposal had already come to de@@ fer the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform less official media appointments prior to the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among passengers accounted for more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously prohibited items smu@@ g@@ gled by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft as they accidentally carried prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had mistakenly sailed with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out in more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also confirmed that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common items that have deliberately been passed by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent said to have wit@@ t@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travellers all over the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly most frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company points out , however , that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain what fluids they may take with or how much of them .
it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t mind : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to announce the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
he has so far under@@ scored that some of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed for the first time a different , less da@@ zzling number in the publication of the latest quar@@ terly assessment : the cancell@@ ations at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Great Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations took place , put Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la CEO does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made every day .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; are expected to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines , never tested in practice , without any major disrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are greater delays , the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the postpon@@ ement of the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline running on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was accused by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a for a long time , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it@@ ts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply strengthened the willingness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with States through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines for conducting and then to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and to set the date for implementation in an agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available enforcement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA of this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said .
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to turn to environmental pol@@ lu@@ ters and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ loops Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade at 4 : 30 p.m. on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be enchan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescu@@ ing and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tum@@ bl@@ jana &apos;s friends and supporters for their concern .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ manu@@ ele : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei by Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent court , to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the upper authority of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the village @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the dominant nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ kir@@ chen@@ recht .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , buried and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two died at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were wrapped and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Ur@@ linger @-@ Hil@@ arius chur@@ ch@@ yard served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ tland .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary church was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
during New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the bell tower and half crashed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain Hil@@ arius &apos; plant as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organisers invite the friends and supporters Tum@@ bl@@ jana on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler High School in Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , local manager , speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is starting at 3 : 30 p.m .
the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers reveal the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of significance for tur@@ no@@ vers and audio schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gen are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i re@@ affir@@ med .
Verein intends to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in four only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fru@@ stration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided on a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , but this had not been approved by the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf District Government because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of the art : before the summer break , the city council decided to re @-@ enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit of the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle affir@@ ms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the district Vier@@ sen last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them for the occasion to examine the matter anew .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argument of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the estate about 65 hectares .
with the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident

a woman was killed in a fatal way .
two more persons were injured slightly .
the state road remained locked for hours .

city and dealer plan for &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e to the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Business Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers for this , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket .
it is planned to be a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of downtown will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action does not only aim at residents of the city and the region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the city council and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offerings , such as the first active day &quot; active day &quot; to well as selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ opened .
this includes guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
the idea was to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ ly made , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities will take part in the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can have a direct influence on their purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new further people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the US city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire service , a wounded man was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first suspect was later found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline as a cause of disaster .
only a few people lived in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
Tr@@ ump started pressur@@ ing from phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump sum@@ mon@@ ed the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly announce that he would not pay for a proposed border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president denoun@@ ced him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , reached the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ screen .
inside , the in@@ mates ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man brow@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , was only a post@@ war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience threw very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were re @-@ created by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want completion , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding tren@@ ches were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot@@ ing for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer to vote their vote .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com issued a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore not came from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , according to the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey into prison .
but when they got away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also clear that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks even formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , cries the H@@ ester and har@@ ms him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , dra@@ gging my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors sm@@ iled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the tough &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends viol@@ ently and quickly .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , clothed with a grief , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozens of spectators caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they all witnessed the humidity of Georgi@@ ans for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky .

children ho@@ ck on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as though he wants to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his team@@ mates and then breaks down in her arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later , the audience joins the actors for dinner .
at one table , a white pair of white flo@@ ats chat@@ ting excited about the Nach@@ stellung with a black pair that they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feel the performance had left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called a police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone is holding Broo@@ ks farm at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he had already begun planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat them . &quot;

in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) can either show a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner , including a Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .

there is great applause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
in 2013 , he still had to let go of a violin @-@ like pipe concert , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of their view .
I draw a positive resume .
max is working as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week , I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in the open whole day .
what is your experience with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; amount : I did S@@ LC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broke off .
I realized that it &apos;s wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , you can see how it is on the spot , at the focus perhaps also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably doing a social worker in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where to do the FS@@ J .
you can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
what is different from the civil engineering studies ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about reck@@ oning on str@@ ati@@ ques .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a fu@@ gi@@ tive , a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go individually to it .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that is life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job cuts , announced by General Director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
in May , in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , a statement made by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive force carried by individuals . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
on 31 May , a huge bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le After K@@ illing
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has wai@@ ved a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , under which states are obliged to contain smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will move forward and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our government partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to establish where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay the year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which is intended to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the effects of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and reinforce respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
communal room wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ sen decided to establish a common room in the future residential area .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it still persi@@ sts until the area belonged to the church community so far , there is no planning requirement for the project to be stem@@ med from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council ho@@ vers in front of such a common area not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knit@@ ting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which was decided by means of funding for the current budget already last autumn , is realised by means of funding .
the building is in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect , one does not want to throw a b@@ ill@@ board between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding environment - as well as a desk roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - could be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried sole means this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the board .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings , with which one does not get so much forward , but now they lean towards the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m getting heavy with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger certainly speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
at Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to split the resolution appropriately , there are three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way along the cycle path of the Stra@@ it of Black on the way from the direction of Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met with a car which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return truck .
Bayern Munich must do without Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the World Cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel managers at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to renoun@@ ce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six review , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official performance of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play smart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommod@@ ates the information needs of many resin visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he unites nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiries come from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Si@@ eber .
the information on the panels is to be updated via the internet .
that is why a good mobile network welcome plays a role in selecting location choice .
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more light than another , although it is far more distant .
in which con@@ stellation I find a selected star and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the park Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there are something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Göttingen transporting association Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun measuring exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light of sun is needed for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixation would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting fight for boxing in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super suspension weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oned World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former pr@@ elo@@ ader , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I rose for Bron@@ n &#91; to £ 140 &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed his willingness to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he loved Lom@@ ach@@ enko as an &quot; enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he was thinking that the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looked very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control over his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection at 4.@@ 30@@ pm , shortly before the end of the connection .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the bank , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for approximately one hour , then the traffic on the left road@@ side could be passed by the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to start the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first win of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result as well , were not the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were two opposing sides too much , and we have to better watch out in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s defense team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ part chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free fall does not want to catch up with the Fort@@ une anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no one else will be on line with Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain preparations than with the four @-@ chain drive .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t have so many play@@ bugs in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also rides to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can talk about an un@@ successful start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; I only judged the start of the season after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage against Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they didn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know as 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be the light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we will sweep them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which must be hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; making such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who underwent a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Authority ( medic@@ in@@ ale verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should make a more accurate assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board has been critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were of minor age .
to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; probably 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Go@@ dd@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases assessed by the person over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the submitted person is 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the results published in 5@@ 81 , it found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they went earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correctly rated as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabili@@ t@@ ated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as an operating circuit .
on Friday , a bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian prec@@ inct is to proceed .
the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a special t@@ act of t@@ act has required the laying of pipes through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project beforehand in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be cra@@ cked first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective wei@@ her in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is single @-@ lane determined by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ge@@ ants is 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties move in one strand , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to reconci@@ le is to take a hat .
the parties represented in the circle of volcanic Ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which on that day shows a peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell into the loud &quot; big election campaign op@@ ener . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top pair for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colourful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the forum A World and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel region reports that he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf called in Dau@@ n first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; well , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is glad that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
looking at the event on the court yard he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at around 20 o &apos;clock in the court yard , in the Stad@@ thalle there are several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe boy .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidates for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy commander Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli exists in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the clo@@ ister church .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet player Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov is Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter with the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites himself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of N@@ ils W@@ ogram , jazz musician , mix classical , jazz and free games into a fascinating overall art work .
this core of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress is assured of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with each and every one I have dat@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always lived and believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during school time , when she was rather dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was 11 , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening the National Republi@@ can Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party regime of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party headed up to the bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , compelling message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Donald in an explanation of the C@@ BS news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as a clear excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct out of the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes whose gold and silver med@@ als have been gra@@ bbed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Recommen@@ dations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the director of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; he said re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
tragedy for soldiers who crashed in Mali
at a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have thought about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
the Minister of Defence Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the fact that it was not yet clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two revers@@ al drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice made by the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ erh@@ ou@@ tmann of Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday guided by a watch of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service started in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the Bundes@@ wehr In@@ spec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the sad@@ dest laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and ri@@ pped in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ manns designed the flight operations of the helicopter &apos;s Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali were not shown by the Minister of Justice : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are only separated from two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish royal couple is traditionally buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , and she continued to publish it in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
in 2016 he retired and will also take the title &quot; Prince Con@@ vivi@@ um . &quot;
as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House , stated .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in London in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year @-@ old rule .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of knit@@ ting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in Germany had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectual intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP against possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is following the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag but does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the Parliament &apos;s resolution was held on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony precip@@ itated the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the CD@@ U , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants his faction to accept them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be regularly elected on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the Land Day draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ a &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphasized , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described himself as a disciple of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ war@@ ted de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land state mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that she gives immediate effect to her country trade , which she has received over the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the national leaders Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Green Party , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to speak any foreign language in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Dutch Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only tre@@ ach@@ ery among voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of the v@@ est costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration ple@@ ases her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony particip@@ ates in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U president Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests into the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ v@@ ests of distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career prospects .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , Minister of Agriculture , is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ goo@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we are presently aware of , a health hazard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house immediately arose and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming acquainted with Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the present knowledge , the production plants do not meet any immediate guilt .
rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they must reck@@ on with economic damage .
as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the event of emergency .
is there only a lack of staff or a coherent jurisdiction ?
it was precisely the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 percent .
precisely this is why a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are available is of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ er@@ ting really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and transpor@@ table food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumer consumers are right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the pan @-@ imp@@ lied means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be worked on all levels consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the situation is spe@@ edi@@ ly and un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) in order to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players , but they have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success were effectively dec@@ ei@@ ving and ris@@ king themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the clubs debt to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to shy away from excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P at the UEF@@ A , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P pen@@ alties in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million Euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the organisation committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup Ambassador will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of over € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because it is possible to have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ g@@ gi@@ er
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced on@@ board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline writes the contract anew .
on request from the news agency , Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ and @-@ white chocolate tru@@ ck@@ les spread around 14 gram@@ mes per year the cabin crew before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generated annual sales of about 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants will be involved in the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
Swiss Life has distributed chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss termin@@ ated a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , first class customers are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the business class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of the story is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before its stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is running out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stiff@@ ening onto the heart of the G@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children , who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy is more based on the watering can principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , still hasn &apos;t forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s Unter@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it is the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the bands how they will attend the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with his East versus West W@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two Buchar@@ est officers fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan @-@ mask is involved - that it often happens like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who was re@@ arranged for a lower length could better deliver his agit@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against Dru@@ gs Maf@@ ia in the Land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office held Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two persons were arrested at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violent acts , attempted murder and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in the southern German area .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly returned to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning should go to the account of the gang .
way to complain large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , atten@@ tively drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s Central Registry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered , among them approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not adequately cared for , the quality of data in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow back processes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also registered who would not have to go abroad at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders led , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF leads such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , as the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office now writes : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) consider these commitments to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send back refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening human un@@ lawful entrance conditions and a risk to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach , blood donation service was already available to other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has donated 50 litres of blood in the meantime with 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the church acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are laid out and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ Delivery Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn maker reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K District Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations each .
half as many as Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter made ten milli@@ liter of their life juice ten times each .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for holding interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase in this month since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and , in 2018 , to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation anticipated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting next February , although it is expected that it will now be available 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice as the pressure on the real income of households continued to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required for cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; higher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank indicated that increases would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year , adjusted down@@ wards , are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast projected in May .
it has retained its growth forecast of 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change occurs after the recent disap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations for a rise in interest and the GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth will probably be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the most recent infl@@ ation@@ ary report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and small rise in wages , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent the income gap , &quot; but she added that wages would be &quot; clear &quot; at the end of its three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for a rise in interest rose because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected to be put on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the exceed@@ ance in relation to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ t , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders search for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is alleged to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court in September after a High Court financing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the move was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) called it &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p Pre@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted on needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ancy by the government , the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and to termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the tops and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so that when you push the door , it sli@@ ps very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne has been able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that affect you and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard in something quite ast@@ ounding .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose not to leave it .
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in an engagement for one of Vic@@ tori@@ as &apos; largest real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million .
former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ bi@@ ak , only three doors removed from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business plan should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with their mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now comprises offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul valued at $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first affir@@ m@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of managing some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case with hundreds of pages with monkey @-@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ it@@ te , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores in the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property where Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ anne@@ au family .
Col@@ in says that he started in West co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to transfer their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , while Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke and Mark are , as Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by text message to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ ing new staff of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ash &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that has fallen into the president &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping s@@ ling@@ ing Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that the Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away for a few times , then their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently aver@@ ted it that Tr@@ ump kno@@ cks out controversy .
part of the problem is that the people in a White House , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former pump officials say that tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where these originate from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously mal@@ ici@@ ously accused a printed copy of a article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of Stab@@ sch@@ ef@@ in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump read the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
in this summer , the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population are expected and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol will report on Friday the action following the winter &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ eting resorts hide at holiday destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol .
21 Post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ fil@@ - more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online applications have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on information published on the website .
travellers negotiate on a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos; row
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are faced with a number of determined travellers on the foot of war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn from the municipality to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Travel@@ ers have their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull par@@ ked , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by the dig@@ ging dug by the council to prevent their incur@@ sions .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; fur@@ ious people have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent on to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , since it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more came evening yesterday , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a local who didn &apos;t want to be named , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the countryside outside Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise from Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to open on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambient Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 around 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as an accommodation for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house back then .
he was to be right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els Group , managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to return it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zu@@ egen and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ les have been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors were torn out , ceilings are broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer talking to our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice citizen @-@ like &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an elevated city centre level , Sch@@ erer highlights .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led , so sha@@ ver .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments demanded , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in the courtyard , which is open to the public by the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the committee took up the work in the past few weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on familiar people .
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations .
the Trans@@ mitter CN@@ N reported that there are already first dischar@@ ges of the board in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing with the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign .
as a result , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more s@@ ling@@ backs in a private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Off@@ er Tr@@ ump came to the centre and asked the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand Jury is therefore also referred to as defend@@ ants .
most of the time , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons for interro@@ gation under oath .
according to the CN@@ N channel , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , his couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ w@@ ner as well as his former election campaign boss Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
nevertheless , the introduction of the board was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses all measures that accelerated the work of the special promot@@ er in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it won &apos;t be established against the president .
there is no reason to believe that something has changed because of this , it continued in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became lou@@ dly , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigations against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special educ@@ ator and its employees .
this prov@@ oked spec@@ ulations whether or not Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president &apos;s ur@@ ging of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could not be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ cti@@ ca a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the scar@@ let fever of about seven times the size of Berlin .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus of 5@@ 800 square kilometers , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it melted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the frac@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
all in all , there have been a series of unusual cre@@ mat@@ ings in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ ho@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and dis@@ ruption was dis@@ rupted a few years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a limited extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change is aware of , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e will grow back or fall back in the long term , and may fall together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these explor@@ ers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , so many ice @-@ f@@ umes of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature also contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counters the areas in which the temperature increases the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks employers to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only a few days before the summer break , 41 new places have been drow@@ ned in administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and function@@ aries work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be held this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; wish , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demands on specialists , but also to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself in@@ wards and extern@@ ally , point out specific measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know earlier .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age related reasons .
it is high time for action so that even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s head , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party .
he had long been worried about a bad surprise when he openly questioned the personnel costs and star@@ tled the rest of the parties .
peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the administrative district with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level oriented to career years .
but the tasks of the Circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hen@@ del@@ e and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO &apos;s rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos; warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself in the form of detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is presum@@ ed that its crew take infl@@ atable ding@@ h@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ riding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have volunte@@ ered to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation Mé@@ dec@@ ins Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days .
for this , three friendly guides were available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ y &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and mountain huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its very best - sporty and cultural .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gears up for e @-@ sport
do sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium lawn in the wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
this also recognised the first federal league clubs , which are increasingly involved in this area .
the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg started in 2015 , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to attract new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several clubs are rising on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 year old in particular that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under the contract , one could be far more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal lig@@ aments to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since become established in which the pros are competing against each other .
and in the 2022 season e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a kind of sport anyway ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are traveling internationally , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ it@@ te and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in the past three years , the turnover is expected to be 130 million .
this is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ it@@ te consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eball star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ ischer .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sports department .
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger .
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep on keeping everything as it always was with football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy forced to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of negli@@ gent murder by Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free to appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , folded hands and downward turned eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret absolutely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day in which I am not mour@@ ning the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity for his sisters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testi@@ fied that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more that single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , jump out of a building , arise yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she would benefit from any press .
the case has shared legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ owner in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
something was different at his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ i saw immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ my and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the bin@@ ds split by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after his first deployment as a Bavarian Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the objection could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also point to Kim@@ i .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ Ele@@ ven , who were young players , de@@ but@@ ants and just for holidays , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of ingredients that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who have been chosen to do the legacy of Lah@@ mi can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ ber@@ ley confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old reti@@ res as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
right back , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ i felt like the one who can take the helm in his hand .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ Request from a change in economic policy - and at the same time re@@ prove the former minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest change in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 will be the construction law .
a role in the country &apos;s plans is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal road network plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says the ministry spokesperson Cor@@ nel@@ ia Hol@@ tmann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce and Industry ) , Trier , asp@@ ires , as is suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports which have been sack@@ ed for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people wanting to start their own company , the Chamber of Industry pra@@ ises .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master test and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction was quick to create facts , but at the same time the country had the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Trier .
so far , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to hire bis@@ cuit in the state @-@ owned mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional enterprises had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister of Economy , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind force company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months of dis@@ agreement , she cleared the field again .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction reaction
one day before the announcement from Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said that the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options as driving restrictions , &quot; and therefore moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the costs for autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases emit@@ ted by diesel vehicles also increase what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
several of Volkswagen &apos;s employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the study could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday on the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
those who prefer to go back to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the construction department wants to clarify .
on the raft one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a worthy wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer , the raft dri@@ fted over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally responsible behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los cra@@ mp n@@ oses and laughter against suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still recording and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists were inspired by cities .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own statements , he still sits still today at the drawing table , works every day for nearly ten hours .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie Cra@@ zy Island is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he relies more on the TV series , which , as its original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence men@@ ac@@ ed by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and disease @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has implications for the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , which transfers the d@@ warf @-@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 200@@ th anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ ck@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children to the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings are enough .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or car@@ tels , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest of violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses pile up , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ ck@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez writes in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ ck@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little value , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ ck@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey mouse mos@@ ques for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a car@@ tel has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ ck@@ ce , has broken the blame for not protecting his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival car@@ tels in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ ck@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and revenues and advertising increased .
re@@ porters kept dar@@ ing to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ ck@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J @-@ award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ p@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that is assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ ck@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ sed like a do@@ ck@@ yard , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is his love for the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and landing banners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells something wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ ck@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the space where the staff from Ri@@ ck@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ ck@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police , who described the governor as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ ck@@ ce has spent three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former well @-@ known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the hom@@ etown of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group resi@@ ding in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolutionary Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had seen Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slim body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that are prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something they have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is thei@@ rs .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by writing in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for justice in Val@@ dez &apos;s case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez publicly accused the authorities of spy and killing journalists , because they told the truth .
she has since asked that she is re @-@ scre@@ ened by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security personnel who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kar@@ tell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were placed next to her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana did from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed drug car@@ tels with an editorial on the front page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade troubles him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ ck@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with en@@ riv@@ als and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as it was promised by a series of Kar@@ tell messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ ck@@ ce about mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ ck@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even if a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even find that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said it had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its incredibly well preserved condition has surprised researchers , who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the arm@@ oured herbal fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ hole M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) earth cla@@ p .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you blin@@ d@@ rown just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counterpart , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to better mix into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal for indications of his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ tive sli@@ pped skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ ni M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ined from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was sw@@ amped by the western Canada until a flooded river floo@@ ding it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house bust still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery .
the more I watch it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped up in a mass ar@@ mor@@ ant .
there are numerous injured , miles long stem and g@@ aff .
approximately 20 people were injured on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the first information of the police , around 17 o &apos;clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries , crashed into each other .
the exact number of the injured did not occur at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of mild to moderate injuries , said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich some ten kilometres long back@@ stage was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also came on the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted down the hall@@ marks of the vehicle makers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deeply involved in his work and has just a brilliant idea .
and then : buff@@ f .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most advanced ticket inspection .
you just confirm by your mobile phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in many more long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to purchase the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button on the electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and occup@@ ying the booked seats Y .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection at PLA@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew , you can check out the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the greatest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , one of the co @-@ travellers not all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , leading to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Brit@@ t@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ at@@ tered to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 year old child , and it is still lying on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed at her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman got his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell rec@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th century .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rell came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she was saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter grew up with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is all come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell sur@@ passed during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question came Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson didn &apos;t centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell closer to the project , along with six other locals the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team followed in the years after Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that &apos;s how I &apos;m going to be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community acting together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a consequence documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; unexpectedly reveal personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was chosen by Fer@@ rell due to her identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ uson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went down the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ uson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves one cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , of which the rest of the stores also profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then ble@@ eds .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be concluded .
the Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the farm women gladly again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , too .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can be found in the gallery , the amount of rent is payable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be too low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why did shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg mean ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is largely offered directly by the producer and is also reasonably priced .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger firms , because the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what remains of it will probably still disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where does the farmer &apos;s market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the phan@@ tom bit gallery manage to drive away all the transactions from Bit@@ burg earlier ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but there is no place for a farmers market hall thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer exist .
when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown ones that are almost un@@ notic@@ eably different - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publi@@ ci@@ zed diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opening on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look , a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , who has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette stu@@ ff@@ ing and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she couldn &apos;t visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained mice became un@@ equal bri@@ efs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created an illustrated comic book &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili &apos;s Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future where the President Chel@@ ean would convert judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama actually only had a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition because Donald Tr@@ ump is making a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de based on the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in organic terms , we are all .
&quot; hopefully , what people will hopefully take with us is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the comic book mentioned above .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of the disciplinary team of the United States as King Kong with a free @-@ talk phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they make your speech cold , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
it was also purpos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a national human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are considered susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as reported by the acts of the County Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a public warning system published by the police department of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead in the scene , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that they now leave their absence and have been excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ gage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any imagin@@ able way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly calls on susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an enig@@ matic tip who said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ KA@@ D ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with Russian sales outlet r@@ sports at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one is afraid to accept this report condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA in November 2015 by the WA@@ DA of conducting dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ KA@@ D ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being
they shared this with the company groups .
it was a purely precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed of no health impairment , was stated in the communication .
from now on , only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ persistent anti @-@ L@@ utter agents .
Al@@ di wants to bring clarity and transparency to his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ ups race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , and in some cases , allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where &apos;s the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low con@@ s@@ ents results - so that you can post@@ p@@ one why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the &quot; Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments &quot; financial website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ kol@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Company lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect tru@@ thful responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that staff can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion tribunal has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ts , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has deployed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives coming from offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
$ 10 million was sl@@ apped in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Sili@@ con Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
the staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , VP of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors can reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointments can be ramp@@ ant and employees dem@@ oti@@ ate .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have more than 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow associates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets more and more insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose your customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot surface and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it actually prolon@@ gs their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the brothers moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises .
20 exercises will be held in the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continued plac@@ arding , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will stop its practice as soon as the camp ends , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been ki@@ cked with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective grid behind a goal post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins should occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that the people there are renting a room and then preparing to draw up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for which social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts evaluation was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wi@@ st@@ fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb@@ nail on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb@@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , browse the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pans on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he wander@@ ed through the site and ruins of the old castle and talked with landsc@@ aping , gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust got full access until 2006 when the last hei@@ ress , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , maps that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting two families .
guys , let everything go down ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the Pe@@ as@@ ant rebellion of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons , which the Dar@@ rell &apos;s family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell staged from the 18th century who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be a Ga@@ un@@ er , always re@@ pay debts and spend money on things that they could not afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his deployment in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ ser@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle hidden in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the opening of the 30@@ 1 year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the poster at the Chapel of Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens , we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is in competition with other local authorities .
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid five @-@ figure sum for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military Re@@ forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week as well .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the presi@@ dency of the heads of state , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers took part in the consultations .
in this way , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , Prime Minister Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara following this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan described the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ comfortable in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the he@@ ap b@@ ans for female Sol@@ di@@ ers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the large @-@ scale suit of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed a further 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is specifically moving ahead with the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington alters the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it fores@@ ees the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by modi@@ fying the way the US will change the way citizens are issued from other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabili@@ tate circuit for race @-@ platform shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the race @-@ platform @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , it is scheduled to be built on the ailing route on which the tourist train goes .
in order to secure the future of the race @-@ climb @-@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , construction work on the route should start again this year according to the information provided by the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ i@@ tise the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this particularly important connection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared General Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country is 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the racing bike Shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a railway connection , especially popular with tourists , between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the range of sufficient number of people is being used to order them again in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy , a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people laugh at them , but the companies have a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he was publishing his new report .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ ico gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is as good as possible for your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape if you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most .
on his website , true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ s ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their orig@@ ination and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R recognizes their rising popularity , they still remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spir@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the ma@@ id@@ servant &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed bodies and the eyes of the eyes , but how realistic this vision is .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the phr@@ asing of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumping great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to let our filter bags burst .
less noted is the power of Tr@@ ump@@ et to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with whom she had fought for decades on account of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same page .
to the dining table this certainly is a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left has been strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer rep@@ el us one day .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself falling away from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison with Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
when tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest car@@ ous@@ el in the New York Park Department , and the top three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ mitting music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city disap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Car@@ ous@@ el is still a curi@@ ously magical experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ olds can walk on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % grat@@ u@@ ity - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ used , while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left prison for the second time .
last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of re@@ ap@@ ers , according to the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
after an appeal filed by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first death belt .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the High Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors succeed .
there is no capital punishment in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger Schools , the four@@ teenth @-@ wat@@ chers from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will attend secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental citizens home in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the h@@ ens yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lively Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle propag@@ ated his wings on a high mountain and escaped .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dish .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ cks who carried the cylinders to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young animal is different from the other kit@@ tens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ se@@ ater that he felt accepted in his new school .
thanks to his colleagues , the former school manager Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps back to instruc@@ tional pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is over , explained teacher Sophia Schumacher .
she left her students very reluct@@ ant after two years of teaching , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ wat@@ ery .
at the end , all students let a song of summer time and holiday season ring out .
in the process , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camping people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and impose considerable fin@@ es on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know about it now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission characteristics of cars in the emission categories Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit has ordered the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the manufacturers announced a swift implementation within the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler reported to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within their framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions go all in all ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the company &apos;s commitment depends on the firm &apos;s commitment and the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE also advises you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would be re@@ trac@@ ted , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive drop in prices of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
so far there has been no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives award @-@ winning Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the Chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars this year .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will participate in the award ceremony .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has already announced that he will not be able to participate in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - and even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that puts strain on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make clear their views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach City Buil@@ der , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been made available to date .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus , taking into account the regular periods of notice , it should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as the Lower House Authority , the applicant has to draw up relevant conclusions .
for this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they were unable to fulfil them any more , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park , for example , have been initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is considerable scope for design for a city building master .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own hom@@ est@@ ead and garden centre can be re@@ acted quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as a heritage protection ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master stresses .
in any case , the city building master has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on long @-@ term employees in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
W@@ acker wants that his successor stays for a long time : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stayed with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be heir to Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have completed a degree course as a graduate engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge of the areas of planning and construction planning .
the municipal building department is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , construction management , municipal property management , municipal building yard with a building yard and municipal garden , as well as a building rights authority , including monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : South railway line locked
according to police , the unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ oben street ( B@@ 116 ) onto the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
near the scene of the crime , witnesses had been witnessed by a red @-@ faced sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a ro@@ dent of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he or the cul@@ pr@@ its would have put themselves in danger themselves and also end@@ anger the mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for rail freight transport , the railway customers could also pay attention to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the Süd@@ bahn route could be led without any obstruc@@ tions .
almost ten passenger trains had fallen off Friday morning , two of which were driving long distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the patient is normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the guiding researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance supporting immune cell in mice is common that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an in@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet encourages more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mili@@ eus as the same system also occurs in people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same tribe , which had been housed separately , did not .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated by the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts protect .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han levels in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United we signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last advance season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
matic , however , was excluded from the pro@@ visioning Asian tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four priority new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar screens were the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Tief@@ schlag for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D prime ministers were always looking for Berlin before elections .
only no be@@ ac@@ ons from the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the electoral fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the provincial capitals of the SPD .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described even in the approach with the opposite wind .
there were deep strikes .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising faction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the country election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its single @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the apo@@ state Lower Saxony Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ v@@ est to give her mandate back .
the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters &apos; will@@ power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German managing director and campaign officer of the Gre@@ ens of the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner sigh@@ s , as on Friday morning the new Job &apos;s message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is at the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the tak@@ eover of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and minor crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the defeat began with an unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the com@@ rade had cal@@ med down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it became even worse - and everything became much worse .
the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a swing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
in the weeks following , the comrades stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly ra@@ pped up again .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communications he made everything wrong , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW ab@@ at@@ ement unit and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister , Lower Saxony , has been in the criticism for a long time .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz was not at all .
the comrades therefore endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Ms. T@@ v@@ ests puts her own career perspectives on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ v@@ est has not been elected as a direct candidate for her individual , but has been elected to the Parliament via the country list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , according to the Dutch MP .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters were clear four years ago : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding funds for town core III
those who want to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , I have been witn@@ essing san@@ itation areas in sens@@ ations .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; successful project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium gave the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 euros came from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how is a refur@@ bish@@ ment area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler further , examine where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role whether in the planned area there is no interest in rehabili@@ t@@ ating .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could then shift again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per property .
the re@@ development area would eventually be defined as a constitution .
the grant period for the funding is running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the survey would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional decision should take place , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each Commune had to carry out the preliminary investigations .
it is about assessing the urban developments and deciding when to be modernis@@ ed and to what extent .
for each piece of land it is also marked as a notation in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it is , among other things , about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler also emphasized that the distribution of funds in accordance with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whoever comes first , first grin@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Village II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation to those present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor relies on a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory body therapist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one now has built in both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn event , which highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers to the details of the military that have been left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ ti@@ cut helicopter was placed next to a Ma@@ ine yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire truck and a fork lift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation .
the news indicated that the helicopter hit the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note also adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second crew was required for the return flight due to restric@@ ting the hours of service .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal workers from using state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform , which was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as na@@ vy One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political purposes .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump started an investigation in February when the presidential jet charged against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet through his predecessor .
&quot; the White House is excited by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew members frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set up US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said one official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget names for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24,@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former press spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud of contributing to our national security , and I expect hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky job
the championship leader of the second tennis league will compete in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ular third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less , the top @-@ runner of the second tennis @-@ league played the meaning for the reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at S@@ V , Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V mainly imports imports from the far north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ring@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump wasn &apos;t really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress gave a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , which have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership , North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the set of threats is enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an Executive Order .
there are twelve weapons available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ operatives killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s rich@@ est organisation of drug trafficking : the Cal@@ i Kar@@ tell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operate only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backwards : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table itself .
with strong contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
as of September 1 , Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) again .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Youth Aid Department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh water @-@ cooked cooling .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at noon .
last year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for by 45 hours of the week , at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita at noon &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 : 00@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have a kitchen service starting on 1 September : they warm up the prepared food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , give out , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy eating and cooking .
&quot; children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of kitchen cleaning and kitchen service - has , besides the quality improvement of the kitchen output , also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison for the city as the most economical one , says it from the press office .
and this , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for about 750 persons in the education field , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , President of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women in total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

according to the police , the men of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stood up with friends at the Kol@@ ping Street rang at 2.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory by managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties propriet@@ or Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; expressing concerns that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly concentrated on the local community and the Glasgow general area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we fully acknowledge the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of the league might regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t be indul@@ ged in pursuing N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution by issuing an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ?
the sensational approach has heated the summer transfer window in the summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board is that the club has always tried his best to care for him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all the clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest at the PS@@ G middle field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers turned around and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ rator has deliberately turned a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 Euros in disgu@@ ise of the vehicle .
the police office Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because he had a car in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au heading towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to him in his lane , so that he had to leave to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the lead plan .
property damage arose on the passenger car .
the driver of the forthcoming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves the relief of Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the abuse is reli@@ eved by the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the opinion of the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scandal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German Press Agency , expecting an ap@@ ology from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Cathedral Master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the processes .
the Vatican paper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that in the coverage of violence among the dome cats , &quot; two measures &quot; were measured .
concerning the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , according to the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Broad@@ casting Corporation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strokes have been a quite normal pedago@@ gical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ ative book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) with R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is contained in the 440 pages report commissioned by Mr. Ulrich Weber to instruc@@ t the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister had used forms of physical and psychological violence .
even with high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could be even more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen cath@@ ed@@ r@@ als Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence perpet@@ u@@ ated by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presents a contradictory picture by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one , many students stand out for his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible for the latter , when a dome set did not produce top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the primary school also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
one can , at best , repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ en@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent certificate , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional appeal , which also sometimes led to out@@ breaks .
the fact that he not only ki@@ cked with chairs and threw the key on the floor , but also distributed ear fig@@ s and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what this report is all about , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of non@@ violence at the primary school , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles .
there is a question of whether it is not more familiar to him and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed on him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , much was reported on the subject of abuse in Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be subjected to any involvement or co @-@ knowing regarding sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : absolutely no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in solving sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are not silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who had been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ rator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him ... to have opened more intru@@ sive or clear or even more clearly than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , tru@@ ste@@ es , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ operation .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or bringing him to an ad@@ vert .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much to read about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
there is , namely , ne@@ atly divided : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the high school of the Dom@@ j@@ ab @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , to other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were down@@ right and suffering horri@@ bly , all took place at the primary school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ et@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the primary school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and was responsible ( witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut his ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , who even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the primary school the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the light of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when criminal pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too .
before that , they took possession of a legal grey zone , as each of us is still aware of .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria too .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time at that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right already .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was implic@@ ated in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice .
this is all terrible and I &apos;m happy that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. sla@@ ving ears and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is the picture of George R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s time in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of corpor@@ al punishment also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , the dom@@ esti@@ cats played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I do not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ condition@@ ally discipline , it would have hardly been possible for him to form a world @-@ tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with cookies and can@@ dies alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamentally ben@@ evol@@ ent , deeply beli@@ ever and heart @-@ good person , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something for a fly .
I regularly receive , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ ans still today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ spar@@ rows are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person , to which they still look up today and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is extremely un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it .
now the stand @-@ up would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
