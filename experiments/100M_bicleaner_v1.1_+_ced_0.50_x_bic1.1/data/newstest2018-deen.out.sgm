<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich presents exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the car-navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historic maps of the digital Bavarian Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but especially informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and congregations in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called Urrulsheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian Authority of Surveying, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from Bavaria's first surveys.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801, today's neighbours, who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph moved the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying authorities." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered hallmarks from the so-called "Urge" from which the land tax was deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small parcels now occupy no more farmers - but small farmers of the plant" "" "Land in the Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space distinguishes itself north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the scene of the October Festival since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete buildings.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at Gasteig" "" "or from the rise" "" "Auf der Gasteig" "" "or" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was established there." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the buying of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients it was first place, later it was expanded to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity did not suffice - the reason for the construction of the chalk renown in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, is located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now facing the area of the former Warsaw prison.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the soccer field of the TSV Munich east, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where this day was the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn will take place.</seg>

<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association to Support Farmer has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri request special attention and caution when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racist-based incidents occur in the whole state recently and here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discriminatory complaints, as well as the authorities of the state who are disproportionately aimed at minorities, prompted the group to publish travel warnings," "" "said the NAACP." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey by the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General's Office, showing that black drivers in the state are reported to be 75 percent more common than white ones.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what might happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people have to be ready if they want to bring a deposit money or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which classify the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th ranks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws, obliging local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration offences, which will contribute to the ACLU's view to further profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "the" "" "Fischbacher Weidezvn" "" "project is a successful project and will be continued next year." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the pivot graveyard of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insight into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketable way for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales can be found on the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the president of BLHV, he described the fence project as" "" "elementary importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot manage profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and cultivated this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he had no organic farm.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leader's advancement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Due to the promotion, farmers often stand in the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forenlisted until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and women, it is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Ordinance (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state subsidies for pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be fenced may not be tractor-resistant (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherbacher Christmas fence project 2018, the motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which want to build a fence about 16 kilometres, is currently being applied.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of conservation is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically limit the legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller grabbed not the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boatowners and liberty-imitators would have liked him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he assumed its importance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta wrote:" "" "I don't want to deal here with a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to, which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable garbage of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable garbage" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a classic exemplary fashion.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty will not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is going on.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh has come across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butt - who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as team captain by the team.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, competing with the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotsman are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The centre aisle runner Muir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that one should observe after a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics over Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from the domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He did not hesitate to criticise him.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in the year 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of that at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's headquarters dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-free head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore blocking people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is referred to as official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans MEP, Amelia Chasse, defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people shooting online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just genuine people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news posting "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor posted as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest or silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County defeated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington's time, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter recorders suggested his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, were overwhelmed by his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a deadline running on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for down-to-earth ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was accused by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor at Oklahoma for a long time, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been committed to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal in ozone standards simply strengthened the willingness of the EPA to co-operate with States through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "in previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines for conducting and then to be accused of activist groups and others, and to set the date for implementation in an agreement," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job." ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">"" "nevertheless, the EPA statement said that Pruitt will eventually use its" "" "power to delay and all other legally available enforcement" "" "to ensure that the regulations" "" "are based on solid policy and the best available information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive reversion of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York General Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA of this week, said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important benefit to health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumloops Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade at 4: 30 p.m. on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescuing and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumbljana's friends and supporters for their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer Urmanuele: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei by Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent court, to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the upper authority of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the village-picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" the third, the dominant nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-kirchenrecht.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, buried and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two died at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692 but had to be handed in later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were wrapped and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Urlinger-Hilarius churchyard served as the last resting place for the dead from heartland.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">During New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the bell tower and half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain Hilarius' plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and supporters Tumbljana on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery on St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler High School in Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann, local manager, speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is starting at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">The serenade of the serenade takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," "" "the organisers reveal the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of significance for turnovers and audio schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumblgen are particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirmed.</seg>
<seg id="504">Verein intends to permit approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim" does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim" "" "has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in four only at the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "frustration" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided on a second wind-force concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette, but this had not been approved by the Dusseldorf District Government because of a lack of form.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">State of the art: before the summer break, the city council decided to re-enter the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit of the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "this is where the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle affirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "the corresponding letters have been received by the district Viersen last week," "" "said a speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them for the occasion to examine the matter anew.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argument of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the estate about 65 hectares.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of four wind turbines, the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city councillor gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="531">City and dealer plan for "home-shopping" weekend</seg>
<seg id="532">Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover shopping in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants to the shopping spree to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the Chairman of the Business Association, Christian König, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend will sensitize the customers for this, which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket.</seg>
<seg id="535">It is planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.</seg>
<seg id="537">"" "in addition, the shops of downtown will invite you to" "" "midnight shopping" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="538">The action does not only aim at residents of the city and the region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, says Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The city council and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings, such as the first active day "active day" to well as selling Sunday, talks with all tradespeople and hosts to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be re-developed or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to liven the city centre - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">The idea was to overcome the lethargy with a network, which was partly broadly made, king had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thüringer cities will take part in the third "home-shopping" day for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="550">In addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="551">"" "the day should" "" "promote appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities" "", "says Streich." ""</seg>
<seg id="552">The promotion under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can have a direct influence on their purchasing behaviour.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs super," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Head of Construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has received a 1.30 m wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener, which is also used as an operating circuit.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian precinct is to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is about finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger firm Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special tact of tact has required the laying of pipes through the structure in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project beforehand in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs had to be cracked first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collective weiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is single-lane determined by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">"" "for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels" "" "Tannenhof" "" "and" "" "Seven Linden" "" "is completely closed." ""</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of Football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from entering the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) in order to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but they have to counteract with legitimate income sources, which allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success were effectively deceiving and risking themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the clubs debt to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to shy away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reached in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP penalties in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million Euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA's sponsorship was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organisation committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar World Cup Ambassador will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of over €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era.</seg>

<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's Unterlippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It is the moments of accidental delusion that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the bands how they will attend the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with his East versus West Wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often happens like a single.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court flat into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my request," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">To this end she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the tops and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is very important, so that when you push the door, it slips very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne has been able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that affect you and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of some standard in something quite astounding.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave it.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an engagement for one of Victorias' largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Tobiak, only three doors removed from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business plan should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with their mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now comprises offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has a value of $316 million and Paul valued at $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affirmvit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case with hundreds of pages with monkey-vits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicatessen stores in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first Jeanneau family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started in West co when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS Group, while Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "Luke and Mark are, as Paul says," "" "bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin responded by text message to say "I really can't say much," because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and drag our family name through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO claims that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trash's White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that has fallen into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping slinging Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that the Twitter habit has ever been "under control," is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that trumps Tweets would have contained even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away for a few times, then their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently averted it that Trump knocks out controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that the people in a White House, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former pump officials say that trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he insists on finding out where these originate from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously maliciously accused a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of Stabschefin Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he uttered false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to open on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambient Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 around 30,000 overnight stays were lost each year and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as an accommodation for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a plan plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house back then.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Luisenhotels Group, managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to return it to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The committee took up the work in the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal calling on familiar people.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The Transmitter CNN reported that there are already first discharges of the board in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies accused the Kremlin for a long time interfering with the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trumpet campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men who acted as advisors to the Republican in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">As a result, Mueller also scrutinized more and more slingbacks in a private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Offer Trump came to the centre and asked the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in potential cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also referred to as defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time, they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>

<seg id="1495">"" "" "" "people who were involved in the meeting were called to a statement," "" "said the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., his counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kwner as well as his former election campaign boss Paul Manafort were also in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the introduction of the board was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new ground for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses all measures that accelerated the work of the special promoter in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">There is no reason to believe that something has changed because of this, it continued in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this Rausage, accusations against Trump became loudly, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>

<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the fracture of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">All in all, there have been a series of unusual crematings in the region for about 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhos floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and disruption was disrupted a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C horseshoe is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a limited extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change is aware of, the iceplate is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C horseshoe will grow back or fall back in the long term, and may fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these explorers do not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, so many ice-fumes of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature also contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counters the areas in which the temperature increases the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU asks employers to step out of the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only a few days before the summer break, 41 new places have been drowned in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and functionaries work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have completed their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships at the circle are obviously much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be held this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently, there are 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the parties" wish, the administration should "" "" develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demands on specialists, but also to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself inwards and externally, point out specific measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that one did not know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a veritable" "" "competition of public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age related reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that even more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter's head, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been worried about a bad surprise when he openly questioned the personnel costs and startled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not arrive at short notice to a satisfactory solution, the administrative district with the unions - perhaps also in co-operation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a" "" "Haustarif" "", "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">Thus the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you move to a higher level oriented to career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the Circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees will take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO's rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis' warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself in the form of detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is presumed that its crew take inflatable dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles ahead of the Libyan coast, according to the Act of the Prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the area for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have volunteered to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "essential changes or obstructions" of their rescue actions.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel laureate organisation Médecins Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the emergency measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine female bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy Trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">For this, three friendly guides were available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream planes.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was a lookout point at the lookout point, connected by "flowery" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and mountain huts brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its very best - sporty and cultural.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium lawn in the wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This also recognised the first federal league clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"" "" "" "we hope to attract new young audiences for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttger." ""</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "he is sure" "" "several clubs are rising on this move." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14-30 year old in particular that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under the contract, one could be far more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal ligaments to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup are on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since become established in which the pros are competing against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 season e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a kind of sport anyway?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fitter player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but Frobbing also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In the past three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">"" "however, the" "" "e-sport" "" "is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," "" "writes the Deloitte consultants." ""</seg>

<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he worked as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artists were inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and disease-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years, which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has implications for the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium, which transfers the dwarf-cades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Rickce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children to the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest of violence, and while throughout the country the corpses pile up, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration from Rickce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez writes in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Federal Attorney General was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Rickce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little value, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we distrust everybody." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rickce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing but silence on the subject of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mouse mosques for drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rickce, has broken the blame for not protecting his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gangsters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Rickce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and revenues and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters kept daring to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the foundation of Rickce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "" "for her coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Rickce team miss Valdez, the fun bird, who could cursed like a dockyard, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells something wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Rickce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff from Rickce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rickce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police, who described the governor as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Rickce has spent three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the hometown of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group residing in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had seen Valdez's column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El Flaco "because of his slim body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office has been dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that are protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they have never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by writing in organised protests "SOS Press" on footpaths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for justice in Valdez's case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez publicly accused the authorities of spy and killing journalists, because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked that she is re-screened by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security personnel who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of police and civil servants.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) earth clap.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blindrown just a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to better mix into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by eating carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been the crayon time," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal for indications of his life, including his conserved bowel, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Sunni Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that rained from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swamped by the western Canada until a flooded river flooding it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house bust still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I watch it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Clogged remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing is unsuspecting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deeply involved in his work and has just a brilliant idea.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most advanced ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You just confirm by your mobile phone that you take your seat and thus validate the ticket.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements need to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to purchase the train, the DB navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under" "" "My tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button on the electronic devaluation will then appear with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and occupying the booked seats Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the ticket inspection at PLAY, he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, work on, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew, you can check out the DB navigator yourself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "second Plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often go by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the co-travellers not all the documents you need for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document you have to demonstrate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, leading to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also only on ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shattered to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18 year old child, and it is still lying on the street," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, because nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued at her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Fergus's police killed just my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed, where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman got his gun and cried," "" "I'll kill you... animals all kill." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and cried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, the two discussed a conversation they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she recalled what she was saying." ""</seg>

<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter grew up with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said, and noticed she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it is all come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell surpassed during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came Ferrell in mind: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that profited from their pain and resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn't centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestract inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals the Whose Streets team followed in the years after Browns shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community acting together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a consequence documents of "Whose Streets?" unexpectedly reveal personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferr's's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, she insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatised type of action" "", "which was chosen by Ferrell due to her identity as the heart of the film." ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV-readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people even though they haven't been built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves one cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, of which the rest of the stores also profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been buying in the farmers market hall almost every week for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of the farm women gladly again and again.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher's shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is largely offered directly by the producer and is also reasonably priced.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger firms, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where does the farmer's market place during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a farmers market hall thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg no longer exist.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown ones that are almost unnoticeably different - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she publicized diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opening on 2 August is called A Becoming Stresemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created by algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data might look, a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, who has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white Selfie, in which Manning obviously sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette stuffing and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she couldn't visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained mice became unequal briefs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created an illustrated comic book "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili's Kanungo, who foresaw a future where the President Chelean would convert judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only had a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition because Donald Trump is making a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that things are going to happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotide based on the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in organic terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"hopefully, what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so are the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic book mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the disciplinary team of the United States as King Kong with a free-talk phone.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "when they make your speech cold, they have won," "" "it says." ""</seg>

<seg id="2155">It was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-ups race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and apply directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where's the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so that you can postpone why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the "Let's Talk Payments" financial website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Miskolredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent Company lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect truthful responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that staff can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main business leader is involved, complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion tribunal has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaved unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotts, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives coming from offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media" "" "came to their right" "" "that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">$10 million was slapped in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The staff want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that's worth their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, VP of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors can reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, disappointments can be rampant and employees demotiate.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have more than 4,000 discussions," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow associates," "" "Habt you really hear me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">In Ruby Tuesday, the company gets more and more insights into its employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to better binding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says wistfully." ""</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumbnail on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome") this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browse the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena pans on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trenches.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the site and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust got full access until 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the period of English Empires, maps that represent what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go down! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the Peasant rebellion of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a recording of a rebellion which occurred in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says. "" "</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell staged from the 18th century who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be a Gauner, always repay debts and spend money on things that they could not afford.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen who sees the Erdogan as the wire-puller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazy, a new report comes about technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people laugh at them, but the companies have a lot of them and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he was publishing his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxico gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy gold has a personality that is as good as possible for your personality," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if you go a step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, true Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men then have Roxxxs?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origination and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR recognizes their rising popularity, they still remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time where the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid 's Tale' ('The Report of the maidservant') are not the graphic images, the entwined bodies and the eyes of the eyes, but how realistic this vision is.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the phrasing of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumping great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to let our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of Trumpet to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with whom she had fought for decades on account of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table this certainly is a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs will no longer repel us one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which trump republicans of the right wing "normalize" that suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself falling away from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison with Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the top three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-permitting music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Carousel is still a curiously magical experience, as here two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-olds can walk on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% gratuity - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood excused, while I wearied the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left prison for the second time.</seg>

<seg id="2452">After an appeal filed by the prosecutors, Pistorius was convicted of a first death belt.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the National Prosecutor said that she would appeal to the High Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2536">The place is already written - however, suitable applicants are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports about varied but challenging tasks waiting for his followers.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has been made available to date.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, taking into account the regular periods of notice, it should still be enough time for a revision.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you want to be heir to Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should have completed a degree course as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with the subject of architecture and have good knowledge of the areas of planning and construction planning.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the patient is normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The guiding researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance supporting immune cell in mice is common that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intryptophan-rich diet encourages more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus as the same system also occurs in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same tribe, which had been housed separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts protect.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green Party managing director Michael Kellner called on the apostate Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Tvest to give her mandate back.</seg>

<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD member of the SPD, lost his nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communications he made everything wrong, what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Due to the VW abatement unit and its role in the supervisory board, the Prime Minister, Lower Saxony, has been in the criticism for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="2657">They let him go, because they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991, I have been witnessing sanitation areas in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>

<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium gave the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounted to 833 333 Euro, of which 500,000 euros came from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>

<seg id="2682">"" "one will, as Schindler further, examine where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>

<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would eventually be defined as a constitution.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding is running from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the survey would only be carried out in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the propositional decision should take place, so that the restructurings can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each Commune had to carry out the preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was placed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a fork lift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event to his superiors, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news indicated that the helicopter hit the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning and remained until the grass was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note also adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, a second crew was required for the return flight due to restricting the hours of service.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the plane during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not maintain budget names for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D amounts to 24,380 USD per flight.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2849">A trade union wants to ensure the long-term commitment to production at its Glasgow factory by managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie.</seg>
<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.</seg>
<seg id="2851">More than 500 employees work in the plant, which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits in addition to other products.</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did the PSG Barcelona warn against Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The side of the league might regret its interest in Marco Verratti.</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't be indulged in pursuing Neymar's persecution by issuing an offer of £189 million to release his release clauses, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the summer transfer window in the summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans Board is that the club has always tried his best to care for him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, whereby the Spanish club expressed interest at the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Scooters turned around and damaged</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown perpetrator has deliberately turned a scooter in the Königsfeld street in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 Euros in disguise of the vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="2878">The police office Schramberg, phone 07422 / 27 01-0, asks for clues.</seg>
<seg id="2879">The police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2880">Because he had a car in his lane, the driver had to avoid a VW Touran and toured the guard rail.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stolzenau heading towards Leese on the B 215 from Stolzenau.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a passenger car came to him in his lane, so that he had to leave to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The Touran driver toured the lead plan.</seg>
<seg id="2884">Property damage arose on the passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the forthcoming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overhauled a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident damaged, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>
<seg id="2887">The police now appeal to witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau on tel. 05761 / 92060.</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves the relief of Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the abuse is relieved by the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the opinion of the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "the final report on the abuse" "" "scandal" "" "at Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication against the German Press Agency, expecting an apology from former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Cathedral Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican paper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that in the coverage of violence among the dome cats, "two measures" were measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">Concerning the grips in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with the Bavarian Broadcasting Corporation:" "" "you like to go to the church and this is a found fresco." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "strokes have been a quite normal pedagogical tool" "" "in her youth," "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the misuse cases, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorative book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "(translated into 12 languages) with Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is contained in the 440 pages report commissioned by Mr. Ulrich Weber to instruct the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," "" "with high plausibility" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister had used forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could be even more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories with him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal involving the Regensburger Domspatzen cathedrals Georg Ratzinger in his opinion is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence perpetuated by the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "presents a contradictory picture by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students stand out for his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible for the latter, when a dome set did not produce top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the primary school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can, at best, reproach him, learn from it too late or have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domenatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent certificate, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always moved from grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotional appeal, which also sometimes led to outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he not only kicked with chairs and threw the key on the floor, but also distributed ear figs and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what this report is all about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of nonviolence at the primary school, these are admittedly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is a question of whether it is not more familiar to him and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just plunged on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much was reported on the subject of abuse in Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be subjected to any involvement or co-knowing regarding sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: absolutely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of the affected," "" "It was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in solving sexual abuse was, however, that most victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who had been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him... to have opened more intrusive or clear or even more clearly than to their parents, dormitory managers, trustees, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in advance could not be confirmed as part of the study." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of any co-operation.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or bringing him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much to read about" "" "Violence excesses" "" "at Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, neatly divided: between the preschool and the high school of the Domjab-cats, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say once, to other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were downright and suffering horribly, all took place at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the Dometatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses stress, the theme of" "" "primary school" "" "is taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and even" "" "paradisiacal" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims" "" "appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even have positive memories with him in spite of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just started to establish himself and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and was responsible (witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut his ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the primary school the test penalty will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the light of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when criminal punishments were banned in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took possession of a legal grey zone, as each of us is still aware of.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right already.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was implicated in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all terrible and I'm happy that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishing, i.e. slaving ears and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what is the picture of George Ratzinger's time in conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of corporal punishment also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the domesticats played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditionally discipline, it would have hardly been possible for him to form a world-trang institution, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With cookies and candies alone, the rebellious boys don't even make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally benevolent, deeply believer and heart-good person, of whom you can't imagine that he could do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, like many former Domspans still today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him regularly, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domsparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person, to which they still look up today and which they almost venerate.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is extremely unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up would command, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
