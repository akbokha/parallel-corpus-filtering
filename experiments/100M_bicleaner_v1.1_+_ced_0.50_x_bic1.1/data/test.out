28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother testi@@ fied that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gal@@ ici@@ a from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as a cook in Boston , had won his dream job six months ago as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a admitted that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
combining his way with his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ici@@ a .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the telephone number of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always stuck in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather schn@@ u@@ ppe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , with a television with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p back home to the feed consoles .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all times - 101 tournament wins - was once again close to horses .
he let himself run with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid .
there is no shortage of awards to the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes bay leaf , Champion @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already lied to him .
a long one is the 18th winners of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for athle@@ tic successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time U.S. master winner was included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the outstanding athletes are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , der Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cor@@ nel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , der Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion where the lava prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger gave a distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump@@ et Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP &apos;s trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are underlying a more basic philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ tract regulations , and he makes himself strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , he has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
that must be invested , says Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost word @-@ like .
the democratic applicants are even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ apar@@ ty wing of the Republi@@ cans .
there could be no party discussions on tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA again .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement will her@@ ald it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment programme Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine wage .
she wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
what tr@@ ump tries to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to stimulate growth .
his critics believe him , that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has placed her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a division managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodation for all @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically , because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ eful@@ s to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are secretly ste@@ aling away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the flight this goes on .
&quot; for example , that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; B@@ ahr said .
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who thinks that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany , Irish , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
the result is that about 90 percent of women who live in the hom@@ etown in the north of Munich have trau@@ mati@@ zed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what is experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation for them only , B@@ ahr calls .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in residence of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , the government &apos;s press spokesperson .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accomod@@ ations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing , or will men and women be accommod@@ ated , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read off at the rush to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
resident doctors in general strike : demands for new competition measures
assistant physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labor disputes in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labor disputes from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC concluded that there would have been meetings to ministers to deal with the concerns about the Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have remained a problem , leading to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor disputes which begins at the beginning of September .
these disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians were struck six times this year , the first total deaths in the history of the N@@ HS .
the Director of the BM@@ A Assistant Doc@@ tors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant physicians and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight @-@ month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable bol@@ dness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was acute .
Putin testi@@ fied and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was perpet@@ rated by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdo@@ gan to hear him .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was released last month in a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti outlined it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it looks at its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the sustained res@@ ent@@ ment on the worm speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Ankara , the Russian leader of state secured a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that have been inf@@ ring@@ ing from the West and feeling ill treated and now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents express themselves at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have ri@@ pen@@ ed the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hostili@@ ties - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member de@@ votes the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Champion Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , headquarters and stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he announced to the BBC Scotland : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor stamp as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we don &apos;t pursue global goals but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop into the brands Bank , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of Staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think we will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

the three @-@ time winner , D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won on G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori susp@@ ects Ju@@ bel when he wins the victory on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone which only few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already won 6,000 winn@@ ings if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered from the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his top form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia &apos;s Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his head of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the narrow@@ est trust of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for the Protection of the Environment and Transport .
in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive and staff leader of the executive staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has obsc@@ ured Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest reli@@ ed Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Head of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at one time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compla@@ ining items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could be President of Russia , since a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by one of Putin &apos;s close allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he was re @-@ elected three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his termination .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od inside the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message released on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to say thank you to the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a show .
the planned transmission of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a Ban@@ ff resident called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that were sp@@ oo@@ ed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives around 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
crossing the bridge : crossing the bridge with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ bank cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ski@@ ve ropes .
the budget of £ 1.@@ 35 billion is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ bank cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a g@@ ong for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of the For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck , we had to close the gap to the north or the west side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing vessel in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station opened on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T al@@ arms after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat was moving out of their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its reach until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast guard boots and were taken back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this caused the boat to be released from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured her .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ rator cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this came to the house , he st@@ ole on them twice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetrators .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
she then al@@ arm@@ ingly al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the ex @-@ wife of the husband .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who will build cheap apartments in Braunschweig ?
the SPD and the Green Party mean : in the future investors should be taken much more seriously into the duty .
how do you react to the bad news that over the next few years , Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 affordable homes ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no argument .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private grounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing support programme , which will cost millions and still have to be financed , will provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter what , so Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of other approximately 1300 homes whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm must now be bought by the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west city , Fri@@ sten run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
this is because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again , from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens estimate that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and luck that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play outside , but rather prefer spending their leisure time in star@@ ing on screens has been pla@@ gu@@ ed by many in the last decade .
at Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it &apos;s about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then on video games , and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ em@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps taken by the average person every day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of tra@@ cked people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take 30 minutes to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day &quot; fell on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also some celeb@@ ri@@ ties who have to complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does .
the new will lose its charm and use the time to make use of it .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is on all this immune .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now , finally , Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast cl@@ apped on Thursday to the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly presented by the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American Women of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will be touring the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a championship title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years , winning 15 world championships , including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic medal of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it expected her last exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring , Texas would be considered as disappointment .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning both gold and silver in the solo multi @-@ campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired man co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pas@@ sports - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a competition for competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will hold as long as it wishes Bil@@ es .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ a led slightly through two turns , the picture was mur@@ ky .
Swedish Be@@ am and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - l@@ ur@@ k .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently when they expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed into fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality .
the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their floor exercise , she threw down Kus@@ sh@@ eba to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed du@@ bi@@ ous .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in a car accident in a car accident
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer accident of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the cul@@ pri@@ t fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police informed that thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y incident because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesperson of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting would lead investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is related to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in his@@ panic residential areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty truck a half hour before the three @-@ fold murder and that it was assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge cases and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , did not know anything about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create that .
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t let go of that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can work with help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund has thought for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we give him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to told C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floods cause ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call emergency sal@@ aries on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ ins , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather services provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
a flood warning system was used in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the A@@ mite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ tmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will flow only slowly across the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi estu@@ ary in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams recru@@ ited people from flood water in the districts of A@@ mite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly over night .
he said that a further step @-@ in @-@ step that lives near would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the flood had &quot; spread out swiftly , &quot; as there was still severe ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ tmann , an observer came near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ tmann said that the ground has been considerably su@@ cked due to the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy rain@@ falls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ oss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa caused 200 houses to be flooded .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were both flooded now .
the officer of the congregation Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood .
in the cities of A@@ mite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said .
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags provided for the residents who hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it was continuing to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses will have been reported as being flooded on Thursday , but on Friday there were no reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in A@@ mite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police informed that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents indicated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was aware of his transportation to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was bul@@ lied with balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he was likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old located in a critical condition , reported to the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were traced back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ cket when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine in the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic race in the gymnas@@ tics club and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison &apos;s Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female designers was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympic Games and was ju@@ bil@@ ant .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but it does not look like sports classes anywhere in the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts are primarily involved in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents for training , training , travel appar@@ el , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these sports clubs are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities out of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to provide a more affordable and easily accessible sports training .
I have founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years .
in my events , we offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality tur@@ nes that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will cause thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team square and thank you for taking so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistant doctors who voted for a vote refused him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t revealed plans to introduce the treaty as an exception and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident doctors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend courses in order to improve care at ung@@ ast@@ ly times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance physicians , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and bit@@ umen it to address all physicians . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes with conversations have led to the government &apos;s reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was due to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibrations and address the concerns of assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistant physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work @-@ fighting activities .
the last strike at the end of April fores@@ aw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 meetings , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ Find for the 5@@ 4.000 people who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged assistance physicians to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labor disputes achieve nothing that is little , but are already bur@@ dened with over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the Committee of the Assistant doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ stle @-@ bu@@ gging with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time , training c@@ lans , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after the authorities have been advised to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS regulator has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS regulator has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls that form deposits .
when the floor@@ covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ logged up to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots det@@ ach , it can flow through the blood stream and stop the flow of blood to the brain causing a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or suggests that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from this .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture revi@@ ves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the removal of a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as an anni@@ hil@@ ating government report today revealed .
the former Cab@@ inet member , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and Rath@@ vents for ignor@@ ing evidence of election abuse on the basis of &quot; sensi@@ tivities in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a dissi@@ dent king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral bodies in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take an ID card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er simply needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when releasing their votes in order to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election scandal in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be removed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious sentim@@ ents of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation in which a person chooses to be someone else .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there was evidence for fraud throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed himself particularly alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - with the older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of badges to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric mentioned 50 recommendations in order to clean the system including the ban on political activists to process letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tive harvest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report being contem@@ plated by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election directory being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to go to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests for automatic let@@ ter@@ selection .
prohibition that political activists process complete let@@ ter@@ heads and envel@@ opes of letter choices .
the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for electoral stations .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Volks@@ Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photography prohibited in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the staff enforce the rule that voters alone are allowed to go to the ball@@ room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric drops over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was posted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tribunal has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jud@@ gement in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the alar@@ ming and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the Olympic Games 2016 in Rio have advised the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot aside edge and band , who proved to be an impressive double @-@ for@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is far from the only athlete who is fighting for gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you believe in the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the American team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since childhood
except K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the American team at arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while Nathan Adrian has been att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter &apos;s act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the simil@@ arities
theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Xi@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle moves spectators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he dropped his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle Officer .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , went as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Xi@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the scale 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor rule , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers in the whole of Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by sound and language .
E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ bet@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China is &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
the I@@ di@@ ot did not capture that they were still on stream . &quot;
Ai Xi@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many were talking to him .
Twitter users didn &apos;t stop when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a floating performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formula , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ used at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the story about Twitter
commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that they will be broadcast .
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly yesterday night with our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on it as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the float and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the midst of business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman went out of her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went off and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the lining , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as it put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she liked nothing , got off and ki@@ cked out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anybody watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to withdraw the clothing from sales after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman took her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it somewhat safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you get closer to you from behind , you should turn around first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat him with his knee in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er is bent down from pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
move the weight to the weapon at the same time and beat the attack@@ er on his chest , then twist the weapon from his grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to transfer your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue in Europe &apos;s dir@@ ti@@ est places
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and saus@@ ages from a serious test - by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rinse button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before empt@@ ying every object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to let in .
but the experiment , which was filmed in the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of le@@ aking the flush button of a pull toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings at railway stations to rinse buttons of toilets , the task was definitely put under a rehear@@ sal
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the movie , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he declined was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometer number of over 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick off after its lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is close to the worst thing I have dug in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories , Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things with which it was easier to lick Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally using products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ ados Uni@@ que Dest@@ ro@@ yed From Del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing Social House in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an anti @-@ social family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ ge of £ 50,000 due to terr@@ ori@@ zing their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ on and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bi@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden boards were torn up , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ pping and cur@@ sing .
Skel@@ on , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was given an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood flooring was torn up
neighbours argued that they had to fight them on the street and had to be inv@@ oked by police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing and her partner stayed forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ on were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we put the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep tonight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testi@@ fied that the family had to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant is saying to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a dele@@ tion is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be aw@@ ful .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who had cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the floor
house@@ keeping workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police introduced a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis , balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ dad received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial inspec@@ ting .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ on who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti @-@ coated .
the police say that they will deleg@@ ate tenants who don &apos;t stick to the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that the dele@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without repro@@ ach as well as those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal to panic after a flying military jet flies to the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal witnessed the shock of their lives
a portu@@ gal P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces laid an incredible storm
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no risk of safety at all .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a flying jet crashes across a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ works without first seeing what came to them by the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said that due to bad visibility , the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to bad visibility , but the air forces persist@@ ently insisted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people also died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly as deeply as possible due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke - which restricted his sight .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot needed to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup outside the FC Sevilla , the re@@ play increases three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ ach winner must rel@@ inqu@@ ish N@@ ey@@ mar in the balance of power with the subordin@@ ated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is also missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training knee , with which the In@@ ser@@ tion at Bar@@ ca has been clari@@ fied at least for the time being in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er St@@ egen are competing in Barcelona for two years as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique had so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen was the winner in most of the other candidates .
before the first obligatory game of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , who was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
at 3 : 2 at the pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves to win the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate division to ping p@@ ong @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Cup first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made themselves the title among each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would pick the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ onna@@ ire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn from the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their cont@@ ests alone on each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not evolve the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless sufficient stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the match against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ an had suffered a ri@@ pple injury after that , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have , by the way , become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ erte in similar high table tennis players .
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars &quot; immense problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary , which is usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed as little as concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported .
having eliminated 16 ri@@ vals in his own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success continue to grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in key states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ rap@@ ing .
shaking Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ US from June of June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were upset by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump ahead , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; the same as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and check afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not doing anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump to continue .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to withdraw funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present any better demand values .
instead of that one wants to strengthen the candidates of the Republi@@ cans for Congress under the arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud @-@ test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud test &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C aims to establish a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to set up a disciplinary committee immediately to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ er .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF speaker shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the investigation and the measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will assess an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an IA@@ AF account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and signed up as F@@ erg@@ uson rotor , handed out the sample and signed it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ yan boss de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson @-@ Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Rot@@ ich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after a number of dop@@ ing associations for a long time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya took on the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a big runner nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sport fraud .
member of the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian athle@@ tics arena .
it could be proven that in this sport it became surface @-@ covering and systematically decreased .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Maria a young mare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she reminds herself of her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli says the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; in this piece it &apos;s about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death several weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was sevent@@ een years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went into a plane in the direction of Turkey and embark@@ ed on a bus to the Syrian border .
the family of Sul@@ tan@@ as was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .

Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .

Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty .
a friend of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ per heroes of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
tre@@ ats wants N@@ ude Calendar for &quot; Women and Men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to release a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that it does the Calendar also .
&quot; we need to return to portra@@ y timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Appe@@ arances in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near@@ Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons at short notice with tens of thousands of asylum seekers coming from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the Association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the attempted coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand asylum seekers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ ec@@ tions several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the vain coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
many will want to start new in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes on refugees itself produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chairman of the Association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
with this , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government called for the Federal Government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as keen as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ Cri@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition leaders .
the fire market as a quality trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ret@@ aries , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len Association for Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper in reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this amounted to 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and with it nearly 29 percent of all candidates recognized as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no question of fighting , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum claims based on the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go there where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the makers of North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as so far is not going to be : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites itself .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaigns , are on holiday .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land tag .
there are some practical problems : during holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang out posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count out voices in the end , only pain@@ stak@@ ingly open up .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election day and last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern needs to pass an election campaign just short of the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strong new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ du@@ ster .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , spreading roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff had done .
otherwise soul ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the flour@@ ishing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to Grand @-@ kund@@ geb@@ ungen ; Merkel federal election circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group was not correct , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a pity not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U disp@@ enses with the usual election results on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that on the country it is rooted out the basis that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly anything in the expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much stake in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Social Democrats la@@ gged 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent ahead of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday misery and move their campaign mainly into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it calls the president of the country , Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green bal@@ lot warri@@ ors go on a search for local vocal ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just kur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabili@@ t@@ ated there is nothing to complain about .
praise is given to those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am and ending at 8@@ pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty smoothly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the semester , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the commen@@ cement of those responsible for construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to setting up residence permits .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg will be restored , the traffic situation within the village is relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy head @-@ manager , Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ e@@ ways were searching and more familiar with their navigation system than the sig@@ nage .
what led to some trucks being fra@@ yed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality demanded more power from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself known on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been li@@ cked .
the Fast@@ est was on the way with 77 hour kilometers in the tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that Rot@@ tenburg will now be open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to break@@ through@@ s in them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; thus produce for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no less slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mile@@ age gap is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily mined are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all restaurants have hit it hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is projected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the renovation of the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff must have been dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , vice @-@ president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B . 27 . now they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where a little more generous has been handled .
in all cases G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also very nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner no doubt that his regular clientele returns to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that its host has experienced in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
it is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now sets out a thick security package .
but what has a tolerance status dealing with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ vers@@ er .
all his proposals are politically reasonable for the co@@ ali@@ tions partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they don &apos;t ask anybody .
other , more detailed points would be discussed within the parties first .
I also took part in this .
however , as Minister of the Interior , he was well @-@ positioned and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second trial for proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants to pose symp@@ athetic advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of these are in itself : he plans fast @-@ ways for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to place some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately disc@@ ard their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of it is political and legal .
many things still seem to be uns@@ ec@@ ured and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with safety and terror ?
yes , says De Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg terrorist attacks were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people did not let themselves be cl@@ inging out in election events .
the inner security has moved enormously .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in the issue of internal security .
in the past few days , it was between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ish argument about the configuration of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister &apos;s interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from double citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles to reconci@@ le sounds .
from a departure from the double pass he keeps nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ install it is not useful .
and in the case of a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tions partner , it has yet to be revealed .
there &apos;s a lot in it , which could take care of quar@@ rels .
but the SPD , too , is currently attempting to profit from internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite diesel costs , the delivery figures are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action there are vor@@ ti@@ ces around a term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts shipping in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest motor@@ car can continue to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July VW &apos;s core brand was weaker above all in Western Europe and thus again imp@@ acted total sales as announced in the Da@@ x company .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market after China , were 14 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany the deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for leaving the EU was also bur@@ dened with a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated at first , a minus can also be made .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the predominantly affected residential brand of the Lower Sax@@ ons is already off lightly due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to continue a sales growth from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software testing device .
in Germany alone , VW will call around 2.5 million trol@@ leys for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer declares the customer a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reasons are legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
the Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retro@@ fitting , and that all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was meant in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen can see the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop for half a year after conversion - and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage , which has nothing to do with the g@@ ass@@ ment scandal , it is important to avoid uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pun@@ ish@@ ments from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
as of September , the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund requires private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros in sight deposit accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said .
he has for some time kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , he now pays the cost .
to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four rob@@ ber@@ ies , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers would have understood and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from EUR 3 million , the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , the banking association &apos;s chief executive , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay coverage for deposits such as competition in Germany among banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it boun@@ ces money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known by any other banks that calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in terms of width .

according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in the millennium that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all in anticip@@ ation of the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ de through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v correct ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I &apos;m walking in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild , before I stop , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of people : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early &apos; 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I suppose was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records rather are intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of fans of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers received an off@@ ence to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar records of records , from objects that invo@@ ke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally engage yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who purchase a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried , as I pu@@ ff through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone just came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP so I can put it on the shelves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ centered , less musi@@ c.@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those are younger people , not older people who only slowly come in .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sexually wra@@ ps pop instead of experimental jazz re@@ conc@@ iles from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but psychological trauma is hard to det@@ ach if you &apos;re standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale .
it rather presents a shopping basket as a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she is driving away with a sweet si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that will be said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to dis@@ courage the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls , who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items meant more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates .
even if my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and in online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through sheets , while they avoid the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake present@@ er who sticks out of the shoulders of uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video view
scientific proof that the Greenland shar@@ k has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen , who studied the sh@@ arks , says that the record was with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 27@@ 2 and 5@@ 12 years old and five meters long .
French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
at a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be allowed to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair products or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and which pose a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the de@@ bris was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is run for non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants pri@@ zed on Friday that the number of the living in the jungle had increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
despite his disap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be under@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup in view , remain confident and continue fighting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro near Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse calm@@ ly what reasons for de@@ bac@@ le would have led .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ driving World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes on Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

join start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people watching video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
on Thursday , Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also interfere with your own .
for example , they can give up players missions and confront enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Play@@ er@@ ese Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to a global media event , Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the employee of the start @-@ up that has his seat so far in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moves to Microsoft &apos;s headquarters in the California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
Be@@ am is integrated in the video player department around the X@@ box console according to Microsoft .
the market of live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
witch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google @-@ Mother Alpha@@ bet .
here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed measur@@ ers : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used for accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabili@@ t@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ shing there are often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for maintaining speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operations ; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
the trailer can be moved in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , according to the manufacturer , with every car with trailer coupling .
in order to avoid cl@@ oning , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way disappear out of the outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the flas@@ hes from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used .
even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 units last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ day ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have struck a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a consol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal tomorrow about his neck tomorrow : fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and let the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun boun@@ ce off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners were going 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au sigh@@ ed in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he changed .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly reached the ball .
a mou@@ thful T@@ ack@@ le from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute there went a touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re @-@ start and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u ra@@ ined through further weak tactics of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the transformation carried a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the match lasted long in favor of the Southern Black Sul@@ li@@ ans whose fans were singing , flags sw@@ inging and dancing on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ ushing in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als of 20 @-@ 5 , and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown advanced the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ ic gold than in these games and that &apos;s what you want .
from the first ru@@ dder up to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who go into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports that made such a benchmark .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th unused work , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph .
behind each gold in the herd is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and no one was more assistant than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and that did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances it is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was hospit@@ alized and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that is how it begins .
rowing itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stirring morning with something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked as well .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with them .
even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , they had too much reserves in reserve .
we were caught very well at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t prepared to do something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group &quot; water @-@ purpose association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary in Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility as a model for large water producers .
it was said that some time ago the original sound was made in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia commen@@ ced the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller stands for 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , 28 years as Managing Director .
he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 towns and villages with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member congreg@@ ations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ schla@@ brunn , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ mark in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the moderni@@ zations of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still , and there was always something new added because water meant living and drinking water was the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has applied himself with a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived literally the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for that he received a lot of praise and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , lau@@ ded Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a loyal tu@@ g .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
from his point of view he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the tu@@ b@@ ings at the high @-@ pressure tank near Kirch@@ schla@@ ger on 3rd January .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Tur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man has a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , so the police .
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t want to provide information about the alle@@ gations or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed by additional costs of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey among existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said German Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a policy statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
but even this is not uph@@ eld in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on their own electricity generation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the reform of the emissions trading system , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of produce cast massive steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price d@@ umping in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have an effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened .
it is not clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have been rather stagn@@ ant again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp definitely did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Association announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in order .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in Leh@@ ra@@ mt &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she says .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good to her health and her mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior Fel@@ lowship .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler describes .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking and organizing , being able to rely on others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the pu@@ ddle in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der Senioren @-@ Organisationen .
in the older generations , singing together had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , dementia suffer@@ ers even ent@@ angle themselves in long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is demanded to the head , L@@ enz explains .
to focus simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows by singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there &apos;s enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the appropriate offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of friends sings in a senior &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with Internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of kit@@ tens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect the calls of cat @-@ bu@@ ys on adult animals has .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itation level of cat @-@ boys in the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to ly@@ es of kit@@ tens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of kit@@ tens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said about the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cats differs with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency .
a total of nine adult males and eight que@@ ens from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a rep@@ ut@@ ations of little ones , which were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger cats which were raised in addition .
the researchers observe their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded differently to the cries , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned more quickly to the loudspeaker , when this call was played by the very excited kit@@ tens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males responded at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men on baby sounds .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , whether they were mothers or not , reported bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Super@@ cup &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r football star .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey has again played an important football game .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the World Cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government sur@@ rendered that the daily routine of normal citizens would not be affected .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
the football is not stopped even before football .
the Prosecutor &apos;s Office issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
in the meantime , the South Korean living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kis@@ r is to be the suppor@@ ter of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially time for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne &apos;s sporting value proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disap@@ pointing season for the record champion was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the first round of K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the South by Li@@ g it reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who at 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ till@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig lay the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue hoping for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez who stood under contract with the contract and in Bes@@ ik@@ tas only announced after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do so , the storm would have to be willing to renoun@@ ce about one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made it clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin , 34 years old , was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics offen@@ ders can laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who compla@@ ined after a dop@@ ing ban her starting law just before the games , was fl@@ atten@@ ed out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a set smile she was still standing in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was fixed that she won &apos;t catch gold , the audience broke into a ju@@ bilee .
but there are many more sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was blocked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to ab@@ ort a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant drug , meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane .
Per@@ kovic denied the un@@ si@@ ghtly intake and was blocked for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold@@ favor@@ i@@ tin .
spaw@@ n Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , stun@@ ned mer@@ ri@@ ment .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete was diagnosed as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after having found testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to hand over Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was due to a verdict of the International Sports Tribunal , CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favourite was only tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications for taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ der and ran already on July 13 .
bombing terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Sch@@ nö@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered car@@ ving and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as rub@@ b@@ ish .
in the approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday night in a Night@@ life .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday early , two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further human being killed , according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach of Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express possible motives , but it is prob@@ able that the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesperson in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid .
in recent days , the authorities would have received sec@@ rec@@ y indications of imminent attacks in the south of the country - however , they did not have been informed about the exact time and places .
nor is it clear which group p@@ aces behind the attacks .
the police reported to their officials throughout the country to enhance security around major government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not turn against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , the necessary trips to these provinces will not be dis@@ rupted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power after a period of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al in 2014 , is self @-@ serving to restore the Kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in cop@@ ing with the ri@@ oting uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just one year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation made the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see references for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ison of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are being slan@@ dered in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group of French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional Compla@@ int in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as far @-@ right extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states on contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians .
he said that he had no knowledge .
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection at a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case - is the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation , Ma@@ ikel said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this regard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have seen in recent years that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern over the fact that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum accommodations had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different , or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left who radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records cannot always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia so slowly swa@@ m that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ asi@@ t became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old nevertheless participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special status law from the International Swimming Federation .
this is distributed to popul@@ ari@@ ze swimming in under@@ represented countries .
as most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ ten just wanted to do something different .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so narrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump is already an alternative video .
he will then go on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , be fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party more and more resistance was formed .
post Incre@@ ases in Retail with Electric Lo@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is evidently large .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
shortly , the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer their electric vehicles next year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether it should be delivered to its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to other companies .
post @-@ Board Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ der had said that there are always questions , such as by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift in the post @-@ owned factory .
Ger@@ der announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to ensure a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leads to disap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K sw@@ aps his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of Managing Director Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain as the longer the success promised by him remains .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after more disap@@ pointing results and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the worldwide number five in the sector faces a new beginning .
the chairman of the G@@ RP will leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the supervisory body with effect on September 12 .
on 1 September , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the current board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , announced the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is supposed to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; executive spokesman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokesman on Friday .
who will be conducting market research firms in the future , is still unclear at present .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , in the case of shareholders , the disappointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago was great .
Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K leader@@ board since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K figures , each shareholder becomes rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would also do the qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in terms of the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were neg@@ atively imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected economic situation .
the Group &apos;s acquisition of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into dit@@ ches in cr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n : eight injured
in the event of an accident involving 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , reported the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her information to an opposing truck , which drove partly on the counter @-@ road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police , Aur@@ ich / Wit@@ t@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the buses could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fire Bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue cars and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2 .
the last travelers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horn district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry expert and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of 1 October 2016 , the charges per cubic meter wastewater amount to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the sewage fee will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a high @-@ rate calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ hausen ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that covers run for these sewage plants .
due to legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ chen@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ul@@ tenberg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a new calculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ scores from the previous calculation period will also be balanced .
Schmidt explained the serious charges of charges in all three se@@ wer systems with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters a year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the previous calculation period , all three systems did not least appeal to a considerable extent , not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt demonstrated that the mechanical ventilation system in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant had to be replaced because of damage .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and at the pond wastewater treatment plant Lop@@ p had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses incurred the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water fall in the three facilities , the expenses for operation and maintenance would be fully carried out . &quot;
in doing so Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment expenses in the waste water systems has remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since one can &apos;t extend the supply area of the waste water utility company Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al for these facilities because these are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , posted a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the Consumer Price Index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared with December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , compared to the previous month , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
snake chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect sha@@ kes Asian cartoon
sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting .
the filters are bl@@ un@@ tless , self @-@ regulating tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps get to the public .
in the past sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have cri@@ p@@ pled criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app &apos;s black@@ face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed to some users a filter that gave them sli@@ pped eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was thought to be a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter rec@@ alled hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vulnerable and said to be unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face was drawn into the declining extre@@ mes .
sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are thi@@ cker than their older opponents in terms of race - might expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in Sn@@ ap@@ chat &apos;s recruitment practices .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the majority of white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokesperson , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will be closed their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership for@@ fei@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence services , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed , a report of the Congress held in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the army committees , secret service committees and the defense budget com@@ rade , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , just Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence of intelligence that was typically be@@ wit@@ ched by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders recorded a more positive image of America &apos;s efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened with Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , noted .
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government spir@@ es under Obama have given orders to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com affiliate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations into the Cent@@ com report are being carried out by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , agre@@ eing with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com has created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of Adam B. Schiff &apos;s House of Represent@@ atives , in a statement .
this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; under@@ mined the morality of analysts and &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s chief inspec@@ tor , who were accepted according to Cent@@ com analy@@ st complaints .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the investigations of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts can sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the cri@@ tique of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a text on how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the asser@@ tions of the government , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this knowledge , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com &apos;s dam@@ al@@ iger hut , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legis@@ lative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel near Central Command .
the USA wins fourth match in the women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know : the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4 @-@ 0 and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which are unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first place will take the strong Dutch little longer from the path that leads the other group .
however the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then the year 2012 came when everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things to better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we can completely rip off the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ man in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a win , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved in the middle and hit the ball in the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Bri@@ g@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will the result of the next match depend on Saturday .
amid the rage of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue , without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts or even real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold at Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swim and may it rule for a long time .
but if I find arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping already has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years became so spar@@ se that many of the people I had questioned did not know that it is an olymp@@ ia sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012 , who has made it to the final round .

the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more suitable for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ful tre@@ mor of its never @-@ ending collision - but also the Gra@@ zie of Turn@@ out and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling moti@@ ons ( turning , pi@@ ke and balance ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go farther , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another high goal in television transmission : that of the world or the Olympic stadium .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I myself feel as a little ti@@ res@@ ome when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13 : 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely overlooked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to be rin@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that the police killed dozens of prot@@ esters during the clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just breaking down here ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more territories .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
circul@@ ating videos about the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is Nigeria &apos;s most populated country and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded rapidly .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ am@@ m Tes@@ home , a professor in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of drow@@ sin@@ ess under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians expressed that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ a , who come from Ethiopia mainly to Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate below a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ra , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and domin@@ ates the military , secret services , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to handle opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections , apparently fu@@ elled by the government and then stolen by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ eth@@ ic city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred for the Tig@@ ra are becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin , ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissip@@ ate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeat asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would not have been seriously meant to be the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State .
this clari@@ fication conceived new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gi@@ bly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant at all .
after making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump recalls the claim on Thursday , and in interviews he insisted that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Clinton would have created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the alle@@ gation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding Mr. Obama IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism en@@ capsul@@ ates Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey data on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
using Twitter he warned that Mrs Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already presented sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to chop off Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then to rowing back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think that he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an additional tone because his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally attempting to not excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ interpre@@ ting his humour .
but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ tails her@@ al@@ ded his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ ump@@ et , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by under@@ mining the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump resum@@ ed his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked sorry about Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once sold out of the market , Café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a fun@@ ni@@ cal café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , set out in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people made it the last loss in a ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ assist wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also new invention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new external office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept many things .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lights from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nit@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
nine months later , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
when the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the club that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the start of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably made the same always the same .
&quot; I came quarter to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
indeed , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for use with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he preten@@ ded to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours felt welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb suff@@ ices to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascen@@ sion to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted from Chinese cuisine in the U.S. while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at the Ice @-@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which had been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered wood fry , this found the pair suitable for discussing the food during the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that puts the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts as they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country was dealing with no more land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ dy was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noticed , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mix@@ tures were tried out , as a calorie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during her research for the book , which also contains recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before , or since then , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - like the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ Cake @-@ Food stance , are particularly pal@@ atable .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa rural kitchen of his kitchen , he gar@@ ner@@ ed like the million @-@ million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or urged him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind exploitation incident .
after the plates had been removed at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they brought forth a dessert they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ ment@@ ée , which ate President Roosev@@ elt at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved some reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
like a Can @-@ Do Budget , he said to his wife , &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life into play to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even during a bombing of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 60@@ ,000 people .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives in the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war area first aid .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him from the rub@@ ble of a house in 11 hours of rescue , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock describes these life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed long that Greenland ha@@ i@@ red would become stone age .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair .
their slow @-@ motion , they measured six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , the sh@@ arks render this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the iron core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remarkably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
therefore , its birth should lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons transport threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us contained a slight excess of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic tests , so it was supposed to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland hair , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k was even 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to their length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the reproduction apparently let itself at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is not a coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters .
also the old record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon @-@ tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us .
so they ri@@ pen later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal , on the other hand , should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
the council at the latest meeting focuses on topics related to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel adopted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ enting and en@@ closing questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying were determined , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and former senior citizens alike .
as it was said , construction volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session .
in order to be able to respond to requests for the settlement of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in some areas .
in the area of Unter@@ modi@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city of Frankfurt has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London on financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , the EU passport is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport in the UK .
this is taking advantage of major US banks .
several banks have already announced that they will shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is speaking the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory agency E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk file ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg has a large fund industry , but also cuts out worse in infrastructure just like Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to access .
further points are the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked seventh , Luxemburg in place 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my econom@@ ist .
as per the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector were working in London at the end of 2015 , 6@@ 2,500 in Frankfurt .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US fun@@ nel decided that Gilead Sciences Inc reserves the refund of the legal costs that you have developed from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was released from a damages payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two Mer@@ ck patents pending in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US judge Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a decree of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and took possession of laboratory work , which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir was based on , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s medicines .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have re@@ conquered full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left the city , a spokesman for the group on Friday said .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ tail@@ oring after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations over the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and reti@@ re@@ es in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Democrats &apos;s presidential candidate .
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Coll@@ abor@@ ative Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
lob@@ b@@ ings critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business lines and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump ur@@ ges him to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke the subject during a speech on the economy of Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett ensuring that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton during the last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded a buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump to exchange its tax declarations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax returns until 2007 .
the clinics now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the fiscal declaration of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only earned USD 100 of their income as a wage , unlike most Americans .
its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and returns from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its support along with the US natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the World Filter , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell , CEO of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell .
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chim@@ ney cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , which ends up to the f@@ use cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom is bur@@ sting with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air .
a touch is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
a last possibility is a ver@@ ge shooting a gold fire@@ work unit in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
Stad@@ council unanim@@ ously appro@@ ves : no ki@@ osk @-@ building at the S. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ covers Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uph@@ eav@@ al after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election , as it would have requested Arabic visitors according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation Sho@@ ah , issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of country code of the hotel .
the country , however , was not listed between countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the B@@ rist@@ ol Kemp@@ in@@ si offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director contacted the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; the cler@@ k of Lanz@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recre@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is situated on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly rejected all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
add that the country code is now added .
police places tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ ald Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters could be seen gra@@ ff@@ iti on the temporary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into crowds on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly , the ambassador shared .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan originated from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , Russia &apos;s foreign representation amounted to approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily Travel Visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces were asked by the beverage brand &apos;s employees to hand out cash and then escaped first on foot and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf .
the police don &apos;t tell how much money has been captured .
the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance will be wing@@ ed with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of action ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and enjoy summer vac@@ ations
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with her supervis@@ ors during their summer vac@@ ancy in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the quiet leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ ater during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ save with the visit of the stro@@ ked zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous con@@ vent .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and p@@ add@@ ling .
culinary delights were offered to children and car@@ ers with their own meat dishes such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ et@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
workshops were cur@@ ated , creating nice pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun was laughing and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the ministers in the next two years , the Upper Minister round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the dioc@@ es@@ an city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is of Bit@@ tel@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms , were on their way .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and shared the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved wife and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but even on the way , the Min@@ is repeatedly made a rest on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and the breakfast .
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
heading towards St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , at least some 500 metres of altitude had to be desc@@ ended at low heat and then climbed again afterwards .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing lake in the evening .
after the morning impulse at the 4th pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg .
obviously reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is , arriving at the Pil@@ gri@@ mage &apos;s goal , were welcomed by the operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the hunter made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to conc@@ eal a victory from the favor@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in the train world championships in London in March , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ ds .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner put an Olympic gold in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard round the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y got the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC @-@ expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a flat@@ tering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic world in the final round and beat the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have so badly gotten away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometers .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record won Gold in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie for world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ ism and M@@ ob@@ bling P@@ ops , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , can be repeated again .
future of the melt @-@ melt of Port@@ land is question@@ able due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; jobs - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus canc@@ els all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company shared .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy set for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
not fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during closure .
moreover , dom@@ ino effects could occur , as the melt @-@ melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Vic@@ tori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry melt , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and ris@@ king a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium mel@@ tdown with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the facility will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt means &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the company announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L reiter@@ ated that the Tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts will have a 12 @-@ month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to exp@@ el the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of enam@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts are warning about the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the melt @-@ sm@@ el@@ ting facility in Victoria and the Tom@@ io facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts and Tom@@ a around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity every year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ? ) , shot reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn : they have all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ d plot of almost every birthday card of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we should have forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon rabbit on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have hit her with the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles a picture band than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leak@@ age before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador , Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence , was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat @-@ Video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is shown in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal courts show 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary figures are rejected annually by the community centre centers , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those with no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their appeal to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already busy at full capacity , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rell community centre said that the last survey of the National Association of Public Agen@@ cies revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that without a resolution of the decision of the federal government , the situation would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just released - all these people have problems of right and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these funds so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign indic@@ ted after employee allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action when she was told that her campaign officer for North Carolina focused on an employee in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months for the issue to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right hand @-@ finger on the trigger , and drew the barrel into his knee &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to do harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed an uph@@ eav@@ al when he said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - gun owners and weapon @-@ friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should ap@@ point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps campaign clearly indicated that the media tore his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ordin@@ is Compla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip because of physical injury and permanent mental damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press spokesperson was not to be reached for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to contact Philip as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of Land Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) show considerable losses for the government parties of the SPD and CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could barely continue to go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent , five years ago , to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was just barely ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 per cent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 percent previously ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of light losses , the Gre@@ ens were hes@@ it@@ ant again in Schwer@@ in &apos;s Land@@ tag despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the survey by the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the survey would only come to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this is still la@@ gging behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( 11.@@ 7 per cent before ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties with 14 percent for the first time .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pirates would be missing in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago Nokia communic@@ ator was launched on the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it wasn &apos;t good at hand .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into the shops exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e @-@ mails at that time , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , albeit agon@@ izing slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia .
being online anytime , anywhere , it is everyday life for a large number of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion units have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the global turnover of the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in early 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get out of the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered to be a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics drew great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities we already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips alone , 40,000 new jobs created and the youth unemployment in the airport environment will end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of He@@ ath@@ rows is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single one infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in natural growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the heart of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investment .
the 2012 London games were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking are equal to a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be blocking charges on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change the coding regarding his ad adver@@ ts to make it difficult to detect the detection of what portion of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the nar@@ rator of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of blow @-@ and @-@ forth struggle is underway between the all@@ uring open source community and the b@@ yp@@ asses since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has launched into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying advertising block@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion every day active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks available .
the company has been working on ad blocking systems on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokesman announced .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ min &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Facebook spokesman in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway ex@@ its
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman was transferred on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred at the A1 motorway in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police declared in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police informed them and any witnesses of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes gave Hof@@ st@@ etter to the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , the court forgot .
the court noted that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have previously rejected Earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and slowly turned around .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus explo@@ its its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , which is similar to evolution , previously thought by planets expl@@ orer .
although it was formerly hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans were evapor@@ ating and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as coach
Patrick Roy res@@ igned as a Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co@@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I have thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations will have to be perfectly coordinated with the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had been recru@@ ited by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 spots and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches hit a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as a Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ en and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike out strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles with regard to remun@@ eration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties sit down for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the wood @-@ field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to address the issues .
the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contracting tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s ratings are followed by a 10 % decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its meg@@ at@@ rend with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion over the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ aden con@@ stellation .
the new data helps astronom@@ ers to understand why stars revol@@ ve in the cluster of stars at different rates , as well as in which context the rotating times are related to planetary evolution .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star @-@ lifts , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates these mature stars rep@@ el large quantities of star @-@ win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more solid stars rotate more slowly than a few solid stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas larger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
as the P@@ lei@@ ades con@@ stellation is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears run faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base @-@ to @-@ base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will take the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ year @-@ old all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was back with power for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mile@@ stones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players in the main statistics show similar values .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed into the hall of fame of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was successful in the field , was so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to having taken forbidden ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect for having received performance @-@ promoting remedies for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done me a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time South ff@@ is@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days do not go no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eball legends have won the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the situation with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy equ@@ ations of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ riv@@ age Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky cannot start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an adult athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier sk@@ ater Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Go@@ in@@ sky have been tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically reviewed athle@@ tics competitions these news are coming to an end .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been detected in Ch@@ en last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the fin@@ als over 100 m butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of the athletes with positive cases .
the news of the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ i@@ ova also le@@ aked in the night of Rio , and the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic athlete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to be the dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O in the banned substance .
Dan@@ i@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ test should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case of &quot; Adrian Finish &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ aboli@@ c ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China also caused violent confron@@ tations among the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang P@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of an argument with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing dec@@ ei@@ vers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ ia in 2014 with the Chinese nationals , but had to ab@@ ort only a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail hack@@ ers out their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of malware Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes &apos; observations , the perpetrators special@@ ise in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially high @-@ performance ran@@ som will be considerably higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently watch a horri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
at first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks carried out quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stal@@ em@@ ate in operation .
the hack@@ ers , on the other hand , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure &apos;s safety researchers investigated the areas of use and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate sharply and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and potentially ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
it is more prob@@ able , however , that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for more h@@ acker to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
thus , one log@@ gers in one of the boards in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey have trusted to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
as a result , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure , the perpetrators are instead threatening the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing campaigns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such block@@ aded heating might well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the cul@@ pr@@ its then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1,@@ 60 m high , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear .
the interior materials are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit surface falls down somewhat .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l available with raised back rests and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to do his job qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine type : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city emergency braking assistant belongs to the security systems ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature controller responds to road sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles if needed the speed .
but full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , App integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel price of 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standards .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not responsible : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible for dangers which are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
illness : when the Organ@@ izer pays
patients who are ill will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family had suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkish lau@@ rels .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective treatment plant , which pur@@ port@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family had the view that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus judgment .
since no contamination has been found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly due to con@@ ta@@ gi@@ on among each other - belongs to the general life risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence carried out by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to the terrorist dangers .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split@@ ting .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminals have to leave the country more quickly , this increases security and strengthens the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of the proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ eastern magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be under penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire is am@@ ended so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is ham@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most recently deb@@ ated duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained according to De Ma@@ izi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical sector , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , looking at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister considers a better social care for him .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of hidden investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior has spoken clearly against activ@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher at the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ q@@ ah ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ veil is problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t ban everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or witness to court .
the Green Party leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate crime power and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring the people of this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it is st@@ owed regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is to change : legal retirement should be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are driving in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams , if they drive over the highway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the following Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the road construction industry extends the legal de@@ fle@@ ction lane by 700 metres between Hammer Straße and exit Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then drive straight from Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided at an early stage , thus improving the overall sequence of traffic on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district refur@@ bish@@ ment of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is driving mot@@ orists every day between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle hole at the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only det@@ rac@@ ted by the motorway bridge .
the second lane had to be built back three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : stati@@ cal calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to absorb two @-@ track heavy traffic .
the responsible national company cannot say how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic will last .
but it has to be reck@@ oned with years , because the bridge has an official rest @-@ time until 20@@ 34 .
in order to extend the legal retirement plan , the state enterprise consciously chose the less busy time during the school holidays because it is to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a musical project now .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima association , 19 students visited the small house between 11 and 15 years .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most of the youngsters in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without a background and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professional guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ bu@@ ye @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany at night a stroke by the invoice - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the sky spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far before the wak@@ eup @-@ bell no longer to think about sleep .
this is all but relaxing .
according to the Robert Koch Institute approximately a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restor@@ ative .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what we understand in the past , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a sleep in and through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is precisely the sleep that many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors at the German House Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psych@@ ic or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are dependent on each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you become a doctor with sleep problems ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eß .
the impairment can be quite different : one is beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping pills can only be questioned only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , emphasizes non @-@ resident dor@@ ms .
for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors , for example , with snor@@ ing with star@@ ters , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , during sleep @-@ conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after sti@@ cking , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
we@@ aving counts : regular sleeping and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , not sleeping on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and not watch the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and certainly not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the disap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olympic is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time he set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete , Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook , has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates standing in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € reward and a jungle king 15@@ 0.000 € should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night on Friday .
the transport system in swimming sport is bad , while dop@@ ing controls are very good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even run it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ster would have to be announced nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .

airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage posts as gangs .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. , civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport picked up a gang that was known to the police from past theft crimes .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid @-@ July and were very professional , work@@ able and especially professional .
the specialists of the Police In@@ spec@@ torate 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who had just entered Germany in order to commit crimes .
in doing so , they had a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if you pass the road from east to west , you pass play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ etto .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor , rooms are still occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin Interior Minister , Henkel has spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three men on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance procedure had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who brings up three children here , is irrit@@ ated above all by the police presence .
they share the fear of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the residents of the house projects .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between house @-@ occup@@ ants and their neighbours opened , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street close to the Riga Stock Exchange .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under large police orders in a regular traffic light , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and sel@@ ectors from all over the world in recent years : with them now residents of GDR times and former home @-@ owners are sharing their Kie@@ z .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognized by disc@@ arded windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were disc@@ arded with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ autonom@@ ic violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury , according to statistics , are directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the majority of the crimes make property damage that tends to meet the newly built houses and newly renovated houses .
there can be no talk of in@@ security for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 .
when it comes to violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here we help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
that is why it was so important for them to get back to their streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the city in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , they are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many - people who are not so well @-@ drunk here live here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for migrants who are angry about colour bombs Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the Hau@@ te Projects and the lef@@ tist scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
whoever draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub , can complain about noise .
all persons presented with names only have asked not to be named with their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the Arbeits@@ kreis indicated that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ breaking wool @-@ kit@@ sch , which has above all a problem .
some - less mo@@ cking but rather focused on the multitude of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place .
searched for was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an experienced wo@@ olen garment .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people , and also behind the scenes as well as networking .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ hin@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or to Government and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not work so far , either on private homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be re @-@ established as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be erected in the Was@@ hin@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need quot@@ ations like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
this is why administration and volunteers are jumping here as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and can bridge time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t work at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore is always also motiv@@ ating others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : did the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would bring them into dis@@ credit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have to look for main and honorary officials on site and in the region after activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have always been in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politicians are afraid .
actually , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would ease the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
chim@@ ney : bur@@ gl@@ ar looking for helicopter
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men have forci@@ bly penet@@ rated an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ fet@@ tered escape .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ ls .
they fled to the city center .
to the police , the police used several squ@@ ad@@ rons and a police helicopter .
the for@@ warding went without success .
perhaps the unknown were , indeed , near the apartment or at their escape .
Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg : police determined after ro@@ cker attack on snack
after an attack on an Ul@@ mer I@@ mb@@ iss , the police are investigating six susp@@ ects from the town of Rostock because of heavy land peace .
in the case of apartment searches , evidence and nar@@ cot@@ ics were guaranteed , the police announced on Friday .
according to police in July , some 20 mas@@ ked men of a rock @-@ like group@@ ing threw bottles and stones against the window of an ice @-@ stone .
then they should attack two guests and have injured one .
then they fled .
at the snack bar and at the adjacent building there was a loss of 10@@ 000 Euro .
according to the investig@@ ators , there is a dispute in the Ul@@ mer Ro@@ cker@@ mi@@ lieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang .
Thurin@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to sales billion
a high demand for medical technology in Asia has stimulated sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec .
in the first nine months of the financial year started in October , Group revenue increased by 6.@@ 7 percent to EUR 7@@ 9@@ 8.@@ 6 million , as the listed company shared in Jena on Friday .
Asia &apos;s business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
earnings before interest and taxes increased from EUR 8@@ 9.5 million to EUR 110@@ ,5 million .
in this financial year , the Jena Medical Device Group wants to sur@@ pass the sales mark of one billion euros , the Executive Board reiter@@ ated .
Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec manufactures equipment and equipment for medical practices and clinics .
the company , which belongs to the optics and electronics group Carl Zei@@ ss ( Ober@@ kochen ) , has almost 3,000 employees .
