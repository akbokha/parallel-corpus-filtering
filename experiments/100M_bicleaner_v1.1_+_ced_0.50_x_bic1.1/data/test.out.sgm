<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop back home to the feed consoles.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer from all times - 101 tournament wins - was once again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family over the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes bay leaf, Champion-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already lied to him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumpet Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP's trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are underlying a more basic philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively retract regulations, and he makes himself strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, he has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">That must be invested, says Trump and Clinton almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants are even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">There could be no party discussions on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement will herald it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment programme Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump tries to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to stimulate growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe him, that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.</seg>

<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Upper Franconia, there are floors or own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to announce an official end of the eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable boldness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was acute.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin testified and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was perpetrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of President Erdogan to hear him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was released last month in a failed coup d'etat almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti outlined it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it looks at its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the sustained resentment on the worm speed of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">In Ankara, the Russian leader of state secured a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an "Alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that have been infringing from the West and feeling ill treated and now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents express themselves at the press conference that they wouldn't even have ripened the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member devotes the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his head of staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the narrowest trust of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for the Protection of the Environment and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement by the Kremlin, it is said that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration."</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it is said (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive and staff leader of the executive staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it is the government's most important task to support your activities as Head of State on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has obscured Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest relied Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he was for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Head of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president, at one time would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could be President of Russia, since a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by one of Putin's close allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he was re-elected three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensbank crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling fans" "", "approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 skive ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The budget of £1.35 billion is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensbank crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a gong for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone for every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck, we had to close the gap to the north or the west side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and the Green Party mean: in the future investors should be taken much more seriously into the duty.</seg>

<seg id="5">But there is no argument.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann comments:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "whoever wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "no matter what, so Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and luck that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play outside, but rather prefer spending their leisure time in staring on screens has been plagued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it's about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then on video games, and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps taken by the average person every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to take 30 minutes to "come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" fell on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and coming from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports will reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "as always, there are also some celebrities who have to complain about something." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and use the time to make use of it.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is on all this immune.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now, finally, Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clapped on Thursday to the championship title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total score of 62.198 was clearly presented by the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team-mate Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Women of Simone Biles will be touring the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday during the solo multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a championship title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic medal of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It expected her last exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to family in Spring, Texas would be considered as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning both gold and silver in the solo multi-campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired man co-ordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passports - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium in which Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she has no longer lost a competition for competition, a winning streak that will hold as long as it wishes Biles.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa led slightly through two turns, the picture was murky.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish Beam and Bodenturns - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lurk.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently when they expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears flowed into fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The power of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, named "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their floor exercise, she threw down Kussheba to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="23">Krautmann said that the flood had "spread out swiftly," as there was still severe rainfall and that the authorities were considering evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer came near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground has been considerably sucked due to the rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine in the women's olympic race in the gymnastics club and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison's Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female designers was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner of the Olympic Games and was jubilant.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterly gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but it does not look like sports classes anywhere in the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily involved in private sports clubs which are maintained by parents for training, training, travel apparel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities out of innumerable, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to provide a more affordable and easily accessible sports training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high quality turnes that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will cause thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team square and thank you for taking so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by accepting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted for a vote refused him.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "in July, Hunt revealed plans to introduce the treaty as an exception and said that the NHS would be in a" "" "no man land" "" "and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The first resident doctors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend courses in order to improve care at ungastly times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance physicians, announced last night in a message: "assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and bitumen it to address all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes with conversations have led to the government's reluctance to participate and sometimes deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of these suffer a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty tissue in the artery walls that form deposits.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the floorcovering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots that clogged up to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">A preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor suggests that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who benefit from this.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the removal of a government report for corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of political rectness has led to the fact that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as an annihilating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former Cabinet member, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, election observers and Rathvents for ignoring evidence of election abuse on the basis of "sensitivities in regard to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and local government, which is now a dissident king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off tapes outside of electoral bodies in order to protect intimidated voters.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman was to be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious sentiments of his Muslim community "in cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it."</seg>

<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.</seg>

<seg id="7">Then beat him with his knee in the groin and twist while the attacker is bent down from pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guidebook his tongue in Europe's dirtiest places</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and sausages from a serious test - by leaking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his train on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before emptying every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to let in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed in the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of leaking the flush button of a pull toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings at railway stations to rinse buttons of toilets, the task was definitely put under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he declined was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample screed showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick off after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this is close to the worst thing I have dug in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories, Niko Vuorenmaa, says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming, which ended that we said "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me tell you this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things with which it was easier to lick Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they are at least occasionally using products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An anti-social family left their social housing after a deloge of £50,000 due to terrorizing their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelon and her partner Shaun Trebicock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had perforated holes, wooden boards were torn up, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, stripping and cursing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was given an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property where drugs were traded in the past, the wood flooring was torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours argued that they had to fight them on the street and had to be invoked by police on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing and her partner stayed forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Delogion were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one of them said," "" "They didn't care for anybody." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be nice.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that the family had to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenant is saying to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family since a deletion is always the last step to consider Cornwall housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be awful.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who had courageously approached us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police introduced a raid in the house and found more than 70g of cannabis, balances, paraphernals and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldad received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial inspecting.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skelon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti-coated.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will delegate tenants who don't stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">The police of Devon and Cornwall told Angela Crow that the deletion was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without reproach as well as those who were harmed by such behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="13">The spokesman said that due to bad visibility, the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to bad visibility, but the air forces persistently insisted that safety at no time was at risk.</seg>

<seg id="6">"" "in the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel:" "" "this music is full of rhythm," "" "he warms." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminds herself of her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First because it is musically extraordinary!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she says in her song:" "" "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," "" "laughs Bartoli." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="21">It is an immensely generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "and Bartoli says the compliment:" "" "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up to date: "in this piece it's about prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as then.</seg>

<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>

<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">Praise is given to those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30am and ending at 8pm.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they did everything pretty smoothly," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>

<seg id="8">The commencement of those responsible for construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to setting up residence permits.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg will be restored, the traffic situation within the village is relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The passing traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were sometimes considerable complaints," "" "says the deputy head-manager, Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneeways were searching and more familiar with their navigation system than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks being frayed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality demanded more power from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that Rottenburg will now be open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to breakthroughs in them allows everyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" thus produce for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also talks about a" "" "no less slight decline" "", "but also acknowledges that" "" "the mileage gap is missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily mined are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all restaurants have hit it hard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="34">Half of his staff must have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, vice-president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation with the indication that the restaurant otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B. 27. now they also have to bear the disadvantages resulting from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where a little more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all cases Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now seeing less frequently due to the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also very nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner no doubt that his regular clientele returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the greatest crisis that its host has experienced in its long-term history.</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly screwed in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière now sets out a thick security package.</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status dealing with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the serverser.</seg>
<seg id="6">All his proposals are politically reasonable for the coalitions partner, "says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package.</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't ask anybody.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other, more detailed points would be discussed within the parties first.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, as Minister of the Interior, he was well-positioned and at a "recoverable consensus" within the Coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some things have already been announced, announced, filed: that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "also, it is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU specifications on passenger data and weapons law." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In part, De Maizière is starting a second trial for proposals that were not to be done with the SPD: he wants to pose sympathetic advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and knocking jihadists with dual citizenship to the German passport.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "admits the CDU man." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of these are in itself: he plans fast-ways for deportations and more possibilities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to place some even worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately discard their documents in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things still seem to be unsecured and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with safety and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says De Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the themes of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the Ansbach and Wuerzburg terrorist attacks were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people were worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that profoundly employed people did not let themselves be clinging out in election events.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking place in the issue of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, it was between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garish argument about the configuration of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister's interior ministers, in which the departments also demand a Burka prohibition and a return from double citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also struggles to reconcile sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a departure from the double pass he keeps nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "we have satisfied the discussion in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">To reinstall it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And in the case of a Burka prohibition, he has constitutional concerns.</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalitions partner, it has yet to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot in it, which could take care of quarrels.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD, too, is currently attempting to profit from internal security.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest motorcar can continue to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in July VW's core brand was weaker above all in Western Europe and thus again impacted total sales as announced in the Dax company.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July, the VW brand sold 449100 cars with 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, were 14 percent lower than the previous year's month.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the home market of Germany the deliveries declined by almost one sixth.</seg>

<seg id="14">In the USA, where the exhaust gas first escalated at first, a minus can also be made.</seg>
<seg id="15">Great support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">All in all, the predominantly affected residential brand of the Lower Saxons is already off lightly due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 percent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales leader Fred Kappler was able to continue a sales growth from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software testing device.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW will call around 2.5 million trolleys for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting, VW reaffirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "after the changeover, the car manufacturer declares the customer a" "" "guaranteed" "" "certificate but does not speak of a" "" "guarantee" "", "as it was said on Friday in company circles." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Reasons are legal subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Focus" "" "had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have been confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was this meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "VW has fully met the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"deviations from these are not accepted," declared Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retrofitting, and that all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "Volkswagen itself does not use the term" "" "guarantee" "" "but not as it was meant in corporate travel." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to sow it under the pseudonym non-AlleEnveless Men's Middle-age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed reemergence of records is not attributable to a boom in the millennium that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all in anticipation of the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov correct?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I'm walking in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild, before I stop, hold my hands and say something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of people: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought items that he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I suppose was a bit too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records rather are introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media team, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers received an offence to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar records of records, from objects that invoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engage yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who purchase a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried, as I puff through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone just came here recently and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP so I can put it on the shelves," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-centered, less music.less.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">Those are younger people, not older people who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexually wraps pop instead of experimental jazz reconciles from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychological trauma is hard to detach if you're standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the shop for a few minutes and considers the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather presents a shopping basket as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is... "she is driving away with a sweet sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that will be said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to discourage the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls, who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items meant more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and in online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with bumblebees on Berwick Street and the leaves through sheets, while they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter who sticks out of the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be allowed to sell 72 temporary shops where people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hair products or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and which pose a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also concluded that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the debris was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is run for non-profit and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closure" "" "for these children would be a disaster, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants prized on Friday that the number of the living in the jungle had increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed measurers: in various federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used for accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed polishing there are often no necessary infrastructure in order to provide a stationary flash for maintaining speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days with uninterrupted measurement operations; the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">The trailer can be moved in a state-of-the-art condition, according to the manufacturer, with every car with trailer coupling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In order to avoid cloning, it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way disappear out of the outer shell.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the flashes from vandalism.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji divided a master class in handling, side-quilting, back, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they were quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal tomorrow about his neck tomorrow: fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and let the attacks of GBs from fun bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners were going 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau sighed in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he changed.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly reached the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A mouthful Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute there went a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the re-start and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou rained through further weak tactics of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation carried a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB carried out fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the match lasted long in favor of the Southern Black Sullians whose fans were singing, flags swinging and dancing on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked out crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals of 20-5, and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown advanced the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and therefore the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="4">The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent when they rowed to the second Olympic old in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that made such a benchmark.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th unused work, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the herd is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental progress that makes the difference and no one was more assistant than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was hospitalized and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve-stirring morning with something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "stanning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It's just how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked as well.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was said that some time ago the original sound was made in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia commenced the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "Bavarian" "" "as exemplary." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller stands for 31 years in the kennel association, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility of the VeitensteinGroup, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 towns and villages with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member congregations are the municipalities of Kirchschlabrunn, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a watermark in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water pipeline construction and maintenance work through office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), purchase of land in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the modernizations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill, and there was always something new added because water meant living and drinking water was the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has applied himself with a lot of heart-blood for his water-purpose association and he has lived literally the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, lauded Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water-keeper and he was a loyal tug.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">From his point of view he described the well-being and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the tubings at the high-pressure tank near Kirchschlager on 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the high-tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Turmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Survey among existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said German Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a policy statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent is required.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not upheld in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on their own electricity generation." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with regard to our campaign" "" "Steel is Future" "", "this is a first step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"others have to follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "even with the reform of the emissions trading system, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "said IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation further aggravated when the world's largest producer of produce cast massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have been rather stagnant again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Last but not least, ThyssenKrupp definitely did not want to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in order.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in Lehramt's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she says.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good to her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior Fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "speaking and organizing, being able to rely on others and learning from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so fast from the puddle in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der Senioren-Organisationen.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, dementia sufferers even entangle themselves in long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is demanded to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and awake beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of friends sings in a senior's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the sewage fee will be increased again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high-rate calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhausen (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that covers run for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Welchenahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt presented the panel, a new calculation of the charges for the waste water systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or underscores from the previous calculation period will also be balanced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious charges of charges in all three sewer systems with relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which lie between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters a year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three facilities is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the previous calculation period, all three systems did not least appeal to a considerable extent, not least due to their age of rehabilitation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welfare, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt demonstrated that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf sewage plant had to be replaced because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welshahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and at the pond wastewater treatment plant Lopp had to be excavated, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses incurred the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still clearly below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water fall in the three facilities, the expenses for operation and maintenance would be fully carried out. "</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment expenses in the waste water systems has remained spared over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious, especially since one can't extend the supply area of the waste water utility company Friesenbachtal for these facilities because these are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million everyday users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein's painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are bluntless, self-regulating tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past snapchat filters have crippled criticism in which they were accused of promoting the app's blackface or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed to some users a filter that gave them slipped eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter recalled hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widespread over the photos, wrote that the filter was" "" "vulnerable and said to be unpleasant." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-face was drawn into the declining extremes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are thicker than their older opponents in terms of race - might expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the majority of white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," "" "said the Chinese-American Zhu," "" "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that snapchat mostly left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the republican members of the army committees, secret service committees and the defense budget comrade, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the U.S. efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, just Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence of intelligence that was typically bewitched by high-level Centcom commanders recorded a more positive image of America's efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence services," "" "a newspaper article quoted the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened with Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed and detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government spires under Obama have given orders to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom affiliate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings as the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations into the Centcom report are being carried out by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, agreeing with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of Adam B. Schiff's House of Representatives, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," undermined the morality of analysts and "gave too little room for dissenting opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Centcom analyst with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the proceedings of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, who were accepted according to Centcom analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the investigations of the general inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts can sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of last year have raised the question how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The critique of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a text on how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the assertions of the government, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This knowledge, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's damaliger hut, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel near Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">The USA wins fourth match in the women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain stands before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India, that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know: the Americans are in the Olympic competition at 4-0 and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, which are unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch little longer from the path that leads the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years she had a hockey player in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came when everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can completely rip off the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doorman in the first half of the game with a backstroke from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a win, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved in the middle and hit the ball in the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in good position," said Parnham, but how well will the result of the next match depend on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even real.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold at Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swim and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I find arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping already has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years became so sparse that many of the people I had questioned did not know that it is an olympia sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and has had an athlete until 2012, who has made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds more suitable for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonful tremor of its never-ending collision - but also the Grazie of Turnout and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling motions (turning, pike and balance) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go farther, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another high goal in television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic stadium.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself feel as a little tiresome when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13: 00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objective of male athletes - as the male U.S. Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base to be rinding.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police killed dozens of protesters during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking down here?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Circulating videos about the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is Nigeria's most populated country and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded rapidly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options other than protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seamm Teshome, a professor in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of drowsiness under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media because cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians expressed that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amhara, who come from Ethiopia mainly to Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate below a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigra, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and dominates the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in an unpublicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to handle opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands protest against elections, apparently fuelled by the government and then stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amethic city, led by Tigray and hatred for the Tigra are becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its allies to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dissipate the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his multiple repeat assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would not have been seriously meant to be the "Founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification conceived new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an eventful period, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After making the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalls the claim on Thursday, and in interviews he insisted that he really did not intend to point out that the President and Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the allegation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump tried to weaken the statement by reminding Mr. Obama ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism encapsulates Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign because of falling survey data on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter he warned that Mrs Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already presented sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to chop off Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then to rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think that he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has accepted an additional tone because his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a leading lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally attempting to not excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while emphasizing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumptails heralded his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand at him regardless of how provocative his statements might be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trumpet, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trumpur's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbiters, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by undermining the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump resumed his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked sorry about Mr. Trumpur's excuse as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a funnical café in Williamsburg in which one could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>

<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing associate of the old cafes, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new external office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept many things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lights from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnitings like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">Nine months later, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">When the verb was closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said.</seg>

<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the start of the club in 2003.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing meal of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted from Chinese cuisine in the U.S. while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Ice-enberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which had been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick man, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered wood fry, this found the pair suitable for discussing the food during the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich foods were very popular," "" "said Brickman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that puts the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts as they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have put itself in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pasta for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "records the ways in which the country was dealing with no more land of land." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central, tense topic," "" "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new buddy was equally tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods that recycle Kasserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," Brickman noticed, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out, as a calorie rich and nourishing satisfaction has precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also contains recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular addition at lunch," "" "says Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before, or since then, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - like the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and the challenge of converting Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Me-Cake-Food stance, are particularly palatable.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa rural kitchen of his kitchen, he garnered like the million-millionaire man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor urged him to stamp an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of food waste," "" "Coe said." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "Brickman remembered:" "" "she actually made people ill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the wind exploitation incident.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates had been removed at Eisenberg's, they brought forth a dessert they had prepared at home: the Pflaumentée, which ate President Roosevelt at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it's called Prune Whip," "" "said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss a chic name." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dived some reluctantly a spoon in the tamed, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>
<seg id="53">CoE won three times a supplement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-sharks will only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches average 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast with this top speed as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This way of life embossed by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock describes these life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed long that Greenland haired would become stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-motion, they measured six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the sharks render this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, which torches from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the iron core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, its birth should lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons transport threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus contained a slight excess of carbon-14 out of the atomic tests, so it was supposed to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hair, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record shark was even 392 years old with 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to their length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the reproduction apparently let itself at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not a coincidence that such Methusaleme live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the old record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon-tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they ripen later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media upheaval after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli pre-election, as it would have requested Arabic visitors according to an employee. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation Shoah, issued his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the list of country code of the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed between countries that could be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Bristol Kempinsi offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an explanation, the director contacted the hotel reception.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "the answer he received there" "" "sent him" "", "as Lanzmann wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel employee said that the measure was an" "" "deliberate decision of the management of the Kempinski hotels." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The reason behind it was even more fury in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the clerk of Lanzmann was cited.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "we were horrified and troubled by this event." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a rather large resonance on the internet in which people called the whole a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "some of them signed the Kempinski Hotel to" "" "recreate" "" "the alleged" "" "Arab guests" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "shame you," "" "said another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is situated on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "the hotel quickly rejected all accusations and called the incident an" "" "mistake" "" "and" "" "apologized" "" "at Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "there was never a direct order" "" "not to include Israel in the quick selection list," "" "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Add that the country code is now added.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the lifting of the sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trading turnover between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 percent year-on-year.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, the interest of Russian companies in the country grew strongly, the ambassador shared.</seg>
<seg id="4">Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "of course, further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," "" "said Dzhagaryan." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">He noted that the exchange rate between Russia and Iran grew by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">In particular, Russian imports rose by 91.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons," "" "said the ambassador." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For this year, Dzhagaryan originated from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="11">Last year, Russia's foreign representation amounted to approximately 35,000 Visas, primarily Travel Visa, to Iranian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">At the same time only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, something from which the ambassador hopes it will change.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the ministers in the next two years, the Upper Minister round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were tested and finally decided for the diocesan city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms, were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and shared the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved wife and so the pilgrimage route was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even on the way, the Minis repeatedly made a rest on field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish halls of the local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and starchy dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went over Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Heading towards St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, at least some 500 metres of altitude had to be descended at low heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse at the 4th pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Obviously relieved and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, the Minis, arriving at the Pilgrimage's goal, were welcomed by the operator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the hunter made the legend proud when he stormed home to conceal a victory from the favorites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after taking only a modest sixth place in the train world championships in London in March, despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as Hinds.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner put an Olympic gold in the Qualification Round, but in the standard round the New Zealanders won the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was almost back after his lap, but Kenny got the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC-expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic world in the final round and beat the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have so badly gotten away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record won Gold in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with officials before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie for world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sexism and Mobbling Pops, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt-melt of Portland is questionable due to the lifting of the energy contract</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers "jobs - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company shared.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy set for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover, domino effects could occur, as the melt-melt consumes around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa concluded the Point Henry melt, which led to closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risking a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium meltdown with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the facility will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt means" "", "the company announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL reiterated that the Treaties were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts will have a 12-month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on AGL income from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been written in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to expel the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of enamel" "" "does not interfere." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warning about the bad economic conditions of the sector before the possible closure of the melt-smelting facility in Victoria and the Tomio facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations said Stephen Mikkelsen that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts and Toma around 900 megawatts of electricity every year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians?), shot reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's most popular showbiz oncels and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have forgotten the cover of their sister and ending with a classic turn: they have all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday card of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we should have forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have hit her with the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles a picture band than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still leakage before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities that model" "" "as" "" "models, celebrities are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Snapchat-Video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised her and called her "the mistletins of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings turned up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She works for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is shown in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) show considerable losses for the government parties of the SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition in the North could barely continue to govern, this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD overthrew 35.6 percent, five years ago, to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just barely ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 per cent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (18.4 percent previously), the AfD would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of light losses, the Greens were hesitant again in Schwerin's Landtag despite a slight loss of 6 per cent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey by the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the survey would only come to 23 percent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">This is still lagging behind the Greens by 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (11.7 per cent before).</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it wasn't good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an" "" "office in the western pocket format" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot of SMS and e-mails at that time, also by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything has changed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there would be blocking charges on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blogpost in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to block again advertising in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktopside would change the coding regarding his ad adverts to make it difficult to detect the detection of what portion of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the narrator of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of blow-and-forth struggle is underway between the alluring open source community and the bypasses since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the fact that the world's largest social media company has launched into the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertising blockers have become the industry." ""</seg>

<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after passing a man and killed, who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Payerne.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have previously rejected Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and slowly turned around.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protect from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exploits its day-side of the sun for almost two months," "" "explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution, previously thought by planets explorer.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was formerly habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporating and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The newest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Plejaden constellation.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars revolve in the cluster of stars at different rates, as well as in which context the rotating times are related to planetary evolution.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star-lifts, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The constellation of the Pleiades is 445 lightyears away from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known as the Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier skater Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Goinsky have been tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically reviewed athletics competitions these news are coming to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been detected in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old finished fourth in the finals over 100 m butterfly, just 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands full co-operation in the investigations," "" "cited Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">The news of the positive rehearsal at Daniova also leaked in the night of Rio, and the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "said the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the athletic athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report it is said to be the doping agent EPO in the banned substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Daniova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes are not pulling the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "We arians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case of "Adrian Finish" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both may not start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, especially the case of Danekowa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic doping, also the Läufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming-sport, the earlier offences in China also caused violent confrontations among the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang Pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m of Freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping deceivers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was tested positive for the stimulant trimetia in 2014 with the Chinese nationals, but had to abort only a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers out their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware currently target companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware Defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the fees demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to Malwarebytes' observations, the perpetrators specialise in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially high-performance ransom will be considerably higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we currently watch a horrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">At first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks carried out quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of crypto currency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stalemate in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure's safety researchers investigated the areas of use and contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate sharply and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and potentially risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more probable, however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the delivery includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for more hacker to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one loggers in one of the boards in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of the companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey have trusted to be able to repel ransomware by file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">As a result, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful closure, the perpetrators are instead threatening the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing campaigns," "" "explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such blockaded heating might well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the culprits then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1,60 m high, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and work pleasant, only the cockpit surface falls down somewhat.</seg>

<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded easily, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than with the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to do his job quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine type: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it assesses many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temperature controller responds to road sign detection and throttles if needed the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, App integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will get the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel price of 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far before the wakeup-bell no longer to think about sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the Robert Koch Institute approximately a quarter of the adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not restorative.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleeping Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What we understand in the past, however, is the insomnia, that is, a sleep in and through.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it is precisely the sleep that many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate," "" "says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors at the German House Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychic or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are dependent on each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated herniated disc can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start pondering about everyday problems and worries, there's an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you become a doctor with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can be quite different: one is beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even drugs - classic sleeping pills can only be questioned only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, emphasizes non-resident dorms.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors, for example, with snoring with starters, in case of abnormal daytime fatigue, during sleep-converters or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After sticking, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping end.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weaving counts: regular sleeping and stand-up times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and not watch the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and certainly not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage posts as gangs.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 p.m., civilian officials in the area of the Dusseldorf Airport picked up a gang that was known to the police from past theft crimes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July and were very professional, workable and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Police Inspectorate 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thieves who had just entered Germany in order to commit crimes.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so, they had a total of over 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like that, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you pass the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioletto.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor, rooms are still occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin Interior Minister, Henkel has spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project, called the area as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point for autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three men on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance procedure had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who brings up three children here, is irritated above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the fear of rising rents and gentrification with the residents of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin interior senator and the police between house-occupants and their neighbours opened, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street close to the Riga Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under large police orders in a regular traffic light, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by the people they occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and selectors from all over the world in recent years: with them now residents of GDR times and former home-owners are sharing their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized by discarded windows or freshly painted facades, which were discarded with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as the words" "" "linksautonomic violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to look at this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body injury, according to statistics, are directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of the crimes make property damage that tends to meet the newly built houses and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">There can be no talk of insecurity for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here we help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for them to get back to their streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the sovereignty of the city in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away: through faceless newbuildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, they are condominiums that are not interesting for many - people who are not so well-drunk here live here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For migrants who are angry about colour bombs Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the Haute Projects and the leftist scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whoever draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls in a pub, can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with names only have asked not to be named with their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the Arbeitskreis indicated that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-breaking wool-kitsch, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less mocking but rather focused on the multitude of desired areas - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an experienced woolen garment.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people, and also behind the scenes as well as networking.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine's customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Washinstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillor to Government and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "it does not work so far, either on private homes," "" "says Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings need to be re-established as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be erected in the Washinstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and employment opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be wounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine's customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need quotations like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is why administration and volunteers are jumping here as well.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes time and can bridge time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is also problem cases," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people who don't work at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer therefore is always also motivating others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences fear radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine's customer quite clearly," "" "which some may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would bring them into discredit.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine's customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "so you have to look for main and honorary officials on site and in the region after activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politicians are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would ease the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women agree.</seg>
