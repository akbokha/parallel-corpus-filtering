Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the choice of Israel that had been forthcoming at that time .
in an emergency call professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said that he has no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic approach to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it wasn &apos;t immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching geography and education .
he completed his PhD in Ped@@ ago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , over his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica game before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stayed in the rooms and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community participated in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l guard , while the university beat &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported on Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans supported this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb did the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt , and that Lamb called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that they have ever married .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated ascent and a length of distance away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict which lasts for almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN head once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was released to the rising Her@@ man Mc@@ Cain , of which none of whom even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to pl@@ unge it .
here are some current survey data suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps of arbit@@ rar@@ iness have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy middle of June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of ten Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son manages approximately the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 per cent of the Irish voters who are ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first country of the nation , I@@ owa State , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament doesn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters are getting used to the idea .
when they expose their gu@@ ardi@@ ans , republi@@ can voters think tr@@ ump is real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten said that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will look at Tr@@ ump campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to lead to Tr@@ ump Leadership , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly awarded their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as often for tr@@ ump .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; the immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six of ten Republi@@ cans say they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs on new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry also in Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa for two weeks shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ro@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square metre of a reconstruction house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places , however , the price rises like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well known .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
&quot; &quot; &quot; double keeper in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern Star Thomas Müller &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply has a run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a happy hit by Thomas Müller led the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign beginning of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8 . ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the finale on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
with his 28 hits in the Champions League , Müller received a boun@@ tiful aid from Olympic Games @-@ go@@ alie Roberto , who allowed a shot of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision , without g@@ lowing .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six matches in the top class , among them well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 he stum@@ bled upon Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ ding efforts they were often un@@ le@@ ashed into works .
the attacks were in@@ frequently induced by playing the game on Link@@ Sau@@ d Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right than his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ a Brown hit the head ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bayern drew their dominant dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle pun@@ ches .
but on goal keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so , for example , when he drove a shot of Ide@@ a through the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was able to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in Ka@@ der after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
after finishing the final training , the World Cup hero gave the green light only after finishing the final training , said Matthias Sam@@ mer , head of sport for &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , it &apos;s already malign@@ ant . &quot;
even with the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
Götz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block evidently had prov@@ oked the supporters of the hosts of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went with sticks against the Munich trailer .
at least one Bavarian @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , harm not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth early in order to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed over 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explan@@ atory author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to a good oral health up to a high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet lef@@ to@@ vers from the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity at Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said Museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as an expert for archae@@ ology conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found it .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower there is also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ der@@ line , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
on Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the tracks towards the station building at the end of the platform and was covered by a freight train that came from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it has carried out serious violations by the capture of the train .
she was treated by emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by lif@@ egu@@ ards .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning clearly corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the United States and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
up to now , the parties involved agreed upon arbit@@ rators , a possibility of objection to their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own data .
there could then be clari@@ fied , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by major corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism , by which firms can take compensation from tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
the criticism was above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform that the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel dra@@ fted in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economic opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged because of this .
it was unclear when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d folk singer recorded the picturesque US State Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs , harmon@@ i@@ ously hu@@ gely close to American folk of the late Six@@ ties , can be dri@@ fted into great opul@@ ence at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our that Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already 2004 and in the vicinity of the Rhine already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeared and had a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
he gives him guitar and ban@@ jo live .
a year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a celebrated master@@ work appears in 2005 .
revealing ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sub@@ stitutes .
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
from the smaller clubs , stage shows here become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ omy ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , who has become much more mature , returns to the in@@ timacy and folk music .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the wide @-@ enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; record in the bottom . &quot;
after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and eventually bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s dé@@ but has been eag@@ erly awaited in the Prime Minister &apos;s brief@@ ings since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s brief@@ ings and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set the first of his six given questions shortly after mid@@ day , although his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from close quarters .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several news stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokesman for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also pil@@ ing up within Labour , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes lay ahead to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and reti@@ ring minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch box in parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another political substitute , says that he gave &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s findings are too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from both &quot; perc@@ ei@@ vable &quot; and quar@@ rels with re@@ perc@@ ussions and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , is represented if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ tram , the speaker of the Lower House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron told him that he wanted to withdraw from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch @-@ Ju@@ dy Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questioning .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and required far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound climbs through accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound was rising brit@@ tle by data indicating a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK rose by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and ear@@ nest consideration since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry stocks were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
Glen@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the company &apos;s packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company R@@ ating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on Bi@@ eber Expedition in Berlin
J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
21 years young , a hanging with a chi@@ pless FR@@ IS@@ E .
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more and more .
currently Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation of U@@ 17 is rotating through .
like Vik@@ toria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ toria from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ sk@@ im sits on the cold stone plates at the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the building of Bi@@ eber : I@@ dol is living here , whose poster is hanging in st@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserves in half a year .
if ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ toria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the upper secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who does it sing ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber himself did not .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising break of the super , he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company , many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and in every doll which looks like he and over the counter @-@ table , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ ca@@ des .
when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane .
he is said to have carried more than 100 million .
some people say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that in the United States and Great Britain , the new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; hit No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanon to a potato dum@@ b idea
potatoes or don@@ ors ?
both - and indeed in the potato dum@@ b , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , equipped with meat and potatoes , revol@@ ves around his store .
&quot; that &apos;s Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lebanese Association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has now been registered at the patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potato the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary understanding of international understanding is also good for its customers .
met@@ rop@@ market launches Continu@@ ity Campa@@ ign to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ case
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branches in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale met@@ a has launched a gro@@ unding campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ approved tickets for the South Australian So@@ ccer League to loyal customers .
met@@ a is expected to publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices implements its annual Investor Strategy Day .
there is a lot at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will take away five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and at the high fixed cost base of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s sales and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ a would likely disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to respond to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operating debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and to enhance I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by growing fresh produce and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Officer Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and relo@@ cation programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is assisted by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ os and deserves praise to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather than cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got ramp@@ ant through the not@@ orious confron@@ tations of Kyr@@ g@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat a Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp s@@ add@@ led a potential US Open win of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite cop@@ ious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too strict .
he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also assisted the decision to not take account of the important preliminary ruling which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a No Man &apos;s Land and responded with indign@@ ation by Serbian officials .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a country strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open up the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would have reached that the EU states would accept more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a concer@@ ted action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency shel@@ tered on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people caught trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of commit@@ ting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quick repair of the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to enter .
some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to go to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have less@@ ened .
their support among men has fallen significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind here .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton however still has a big advantage with the older voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections would say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps it is not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approval to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presi@@ dency in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked by the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will be increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this number decreased from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic elec@@ tors call questions of elec@@ ting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of the pre @-@ elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ ds best cut off with hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be made , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions on the whole .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half the Americans now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views are deterior@@ ated by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for her among registered voters . only 32 percent see her as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time 55 per cent of those entitled to vote nationwide also see tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good scores in leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush proceed best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not believe him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is now suspended , and others lose dramatic momentum .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out last month before Fox News Deb@@ ate , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received with demographic groups and has sur@@ passed tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin on the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the surveys - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly showed tr@@ ump ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the ex @-@ neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing tourists to find even more warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College Neul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said he had been charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and was attacked repeatedly while trying to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined of headache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and set the best of the Brotherhood above that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has been dying every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge for murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of ill attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
there will be a rise in interest , and the bro@@ w will fall into bankruptcy , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first increase in interest rates and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
thus , representatives of the US Central Bank have so sharply stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could find out , however , that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a view based on historical trends as to how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency to be compensated for 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the last 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase the interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on shares ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally later in the increase cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could ha@@ sten a recession .
most not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 net interest increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent , only a few expect this to continue and anticipate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants accepted the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were held at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading accounts for only 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all the increase cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ tor@@ ys very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volatile , since the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first incre@@ ment / reduction takes place in the cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increase cycle &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the loans fall immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to the conver@@ gence of longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; she wrote .
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat@@ ter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and entire businesses , companies that handle the larger share of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded average earnings after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ encing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , claims a leading MP and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said to the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evapor@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is increasingly no longer distingu@@ ishable from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham says .
BBC @-@ General Director denied the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it must be worked harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , to tramp@@ le commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory Euro MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins seized The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he would like the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it launched an entertainment series next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November stopped the issues
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we may experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decline in sales .
experts believe buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought because of bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried the drow@@ ned in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia partially dis@@ covers the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane collap@@ sed at Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respect when the first of the dead arrived their final journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed over to the holy place , where only days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the Bin Laden family building because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 victims who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ b of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual p@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an will continue after Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the down@@ fall of the crane which pl@@ ung@@ ed into a large mos@@ que courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ch , later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the breakdown of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
Ben Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a mad son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) have to be paid to relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other wounded get half of this amount . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has asc@@ ended
this means that 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores that are aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets throughout the country
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put down its h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European tra@@ des@@ men carrying out the work in their home
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to the painting of walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to do DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open another 200 Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 selling points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate with the employees .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mrs Lau@@ ry : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and revenues after the group re@@ trac@@ ted the cost of closing the stores .
due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation at the K@@ lagen@@ furt State Court .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he has been convic@@ ted of this alle@@ gation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he deals with the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial offen@@ se .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
on the basis of the alle@@ gations of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that an asset hadn &apos;t come into being at any time .
the sports officials only charged expenses and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , large @-@ run audi@@ tor of the financial district . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies have been laid down at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success the reimbur@@ sement of the expense allowance had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , in the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
for this reason , package and non @-@ detailed accounts seemed to be the same as the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and dic@@ tion@@ aries administered the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial support , but important is only the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of the official investigations , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the bank &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this securities account was posted on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and according to the statement of the association , it was not known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know a long answer to this .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified herself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , judges and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never made any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the official said he had never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter money and diets .
he charged € 1,000 per month to the society , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not show exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
the second accused was also entitled to o@@ dom@@ eter allowance .
all the exercises had to be done in cash , and he explained in his statement from his hom@@ etown of international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stamps another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ fic will break down further jobs during the company &apos;s split@@ ting up .
the sub@@ stitu@@ tions at the US computer @-@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer segment .
the company announced on Tuesday that costs will be saved in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) .
the move will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion that will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share declined by 2.3 percent .
the company , which is raised with printers from Pal@@ o Alto , California , currently divi@@ des itself into a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a again disap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers after his services were the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo &apos;s latest .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split@@ ting up and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted only late that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more stores online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mostly be rejected : 54 per cent said , 35 percent agreed .

on the other hand , 24 per cent are likely to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian government Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed declined , 20 percent would be .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence break on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ lights against several hundred refugees .
Euron@@ ews &apos; correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the scenes , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water gun ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially started using pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn some caution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees stuck together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
also the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police have suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est started NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ dly , senior assistant at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a slight inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global proportions .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a move are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Prot@@ ectors at Delta State University bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed ap@@ ologies
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could do it wrong , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot on someone and killed one .
lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police interro@@ gated the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to undo it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who declared that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed at the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he won &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his life lau on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the corporation
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
150 of the approximately 1000 executives around the world will cost the work@@ station of the Group .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cost @-@ efficient Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to create a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year of cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a management board for passenger operations in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the executive team headed by chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the pilot agreement ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ stopped strike on this Thursday .
this shared the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a forec@@ asted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come as quickly as possible to viable results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is moving towards the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the lef@@ tist def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al hopes that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w turned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a dual frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the suspension of an el@@ tro@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a T@@ we@@ et at Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK @-@ Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in a different direction so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , published his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron pur@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead reflects an ingredient of the film version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the middle of walled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads .
as if that wasn &apos;t susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron sometimes reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ un @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears that the local environment is rav@@ aged by the curious Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ingly angry creature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said the text was likely to come from Cameron &apos;s electoral circuit .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ side victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown magnitude on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving England &apos;s test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude even though he did not perform such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ dia got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ Factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of suggest@@ ing Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would yield an extra spin @-@ bowl and would get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed person has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ eds immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me very much as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ ins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes in for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can get fresh breeze in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot took a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they are winning allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t let us alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will get a leg out to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so perhaps some of these ministers may intentionally not plan helpful comments , completely in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , but did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ist who made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Stra@@ ight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his cra@@ ft@@ iness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing sc@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ ch@@ opping foreigners , and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries that have most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about her , but found out that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle about the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor for him .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly greeting on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he had no time to waste for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendencies and the wild relatives of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ woman can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their postpon@@ ement convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right not to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe allowing him to keep his support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins is sure to think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power on which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , what was called the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a government @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; based on the P@@ he his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously received British American Tob@@ acco &apos;s Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these compounds or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been premature to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J claims have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every other lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative risks in comparison to tobacco .
almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ville , says former chief of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years in his time at Channel 4 , he tried to get in contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent that would also be clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ville is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I try to see how this is going to be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give that again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gar@@ t talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ville .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue when they go on their hypo@@ critical missions for the justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s right because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also told the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform , form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that just a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking &quot; on public television channels in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and enter into alliances with the commercial channels to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to hear .
the impulses work through the switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to support the membrane can@@ als responding to ultrasound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it if they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves effect the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that are assigned to them , according to a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ h @-@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissues un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for specific neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries .
many artists join activists within protest movements and notice that they have to move outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters greet commuters in the subway .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the weapons fair - through a void of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation remains vibrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors show fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the move into student resi@@ dences stretches from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have sab@@ b@@ ati@@ zed where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly say Mar@@ mite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it ste@@ ers the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear themselves and put their under@@ wear around .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship at university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences build a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ oh@@ m culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS instead of t@@ apping .
apro@@ pos . kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
since you start your university at the peak of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates are oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and in the end perhaps will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when they kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a ste@@ aling , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to their milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall asked her neighbours if it makes them feel a bit qui@@ eter , because it &apos;s three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbors for two hours before she let her own music sp@@ rou@@ t , shut her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together friends to her ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a bit of reason .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .

terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ han@@ de@@ ers , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need room for housing , but also the single mother and the low wage ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds housing blocks for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here to a great extent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ der : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units each with four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge area .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have done my project correctly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gil@@ dner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated it is always the im@@ pending dam@@ o@@ cking sword special construction and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the single mother or the low wage ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ priced today .
that is why it is all about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
some have encountered problems after the installation because they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by creating the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may be hal@@ ted half way and this could result in a shut@@ down of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula One , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one slogan against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup 2nd stressed before the start to the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .

whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held up for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the federal utility company 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which was accepted by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent for talent should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the centre of Alten@@ entrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new agency at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care insurance benefits .
for many years we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many services of insurance companies are not rarely used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedicated himself to the improvement in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular meeting . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o &apos;clock and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

&quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning certainty , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Hü@@ mmer who also points to the sale of tickets now .
it is something special for our team to play against a third party .
we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , as flood @-@ light games have a special appeal .
in the round of the last 16 teams , the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg won first FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the Region@@ alli@@ sts 1 . FC Schw@@ einf@@ urt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away in age 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the message .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna near Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury chamber in the Hof@@ burg in Vienna and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
Park@@ penalty : Tim Wiese repro@@ aches polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has fallen in love in Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , meanwhile Tim Wiese , Ex @-@ Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and was engaged in Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he has not intellectu@@ ally attached .
Wiese was cutting his hair in the inner city of the city , when he saw a parking space house@@ keeper presenting a bal@@ lot for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
as a result , Wiese was r@@ ushing out of the business , insul@@ ted the officer , and accused her of making a fine fine of money before the feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether a meadow will be displayed , or not .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft fuel station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and struck him with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al frac@@ ture and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the m@@ allets , he left his victim at first .
from his friends , the wounded young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ rator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and passed demonstr@@ atively over there .
when one did not see the vehicle any more , the injured in front of the building went to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male .
with the help of a hammer @-@ stick , one beat on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far , only a vag@@ ue documentation is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ and @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and gu@@ ardi@@ ans to sign up under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller to acquire Fel@@ steh@@ breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ breaks .
the mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ förder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Henry fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ er reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds in the coming months with half a position .
after a renovation phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then , he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the cliff faces met with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l years ago , who are currently completing their specialist medical education at the Ver@@ den Hospital and coming to practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to run its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so one agreed , the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several doctor &apos;s offices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as an emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the DRC @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ er works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ related EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 50,000 Euros will be given to the Müll@@ ers within the framework of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ breaks in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor has found himself , she would have gone .
by the way , anyone who visits Müll@@ ers consultations will continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the fields .
their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ er re@@ members smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she already felt after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients still , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband supplements laugh@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone wanting to apply for asylum can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia contempl@@ ating &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that even Slovenia would allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see so much in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an outside border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to abri@@ dge its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to stop in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik always has police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country accounts for about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the Belgrade Government , however , denied that it was wise to propose certain routes : &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do so , &quot; was called .
according to media reports , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , and more buses would be expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way throughout the night of the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary was admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive limits to border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently testi@@ fied to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , leading to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees will now want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high numbers of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of getting an insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der stores should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched by the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively bu@@ stle around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly comfortably walking .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large panels each with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to their 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks as the volunteers .
while some of the pass@@ ers go spontaneously to the chal@@ k and read the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realise that for me eventually the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Mannheim @-@ based Di@@ ak@@ onic Work Institute , which , together with the Car@@ it@@ as Association , is the suppor@@ ter of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce .
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying should still be afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open up people .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning worker belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with the topic of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce sought an honorary title by calling , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and Hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ner companions .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ land transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than the previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level of view comes in spite of the price increases , which are 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging transports of heavy and large packages , which will be charged as of November .
the company said that the result would nonetheless be expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the Company considers &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .

F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which resulted in shipments of sales in its unit Express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below record high on June 11 .
on its most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story session hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress to maintain US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that has been close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do to secure the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who have recently been sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage weigh@@ ted by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy su@@ stains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation in order to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % in the past month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation steadily progres@@ sed below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macroeconomics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only the developments elsewhere but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets up for net interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able impacts on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 Market Bla@@ de , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Bank of England &apos;s interest @-@ setting .
the latest turbul@@ ence does not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to go into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a little help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
even in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still very fond of her 74 L@@ enses .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum reception at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different from teaching at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the SP@@ RS Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization tries to shed women in a sho@@ cking manner about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them against the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat@@ ter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Bern@@ ina sports grounds is moving step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the revised construction application has been unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
previously , among other things , the panel had decided on an application for a construction legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from a valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ centered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and roof shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this is how we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was , in turn , about the roof ti@@ lt , which , for energy reasons , is stipul@@ ated differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan regarding the roof ti@@ lt did not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ina municipal council normally drives more restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project during the gymnas@@ tics construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense .
supplements are expected from school and lati@@ tude sports .
in the next stage of the proceedings , the building proposal for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be presented to the Land Council for examination .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision about this will be made by the Supervisory Board and the meeting conven@@ es on Wednesday 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the continuing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed about the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to succeed , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in the interior station on gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board agree to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ell@@ ess , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this in 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Land@@ Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the supervisory board , has accepted rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property goes on , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , there is a short @-@ term maintenance of Car@@ itas and a daily business psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are called for Berg@@ ische HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) .
although the main league leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the last season , the Bad@@ eners in Bh@@ c bought a painful defeat and got something good there .
hunting accident with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the event on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District Wit@@ tenberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police shared .
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospital .
at first it was not clear how exactly the accident could come .
the police are investigating .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing victims of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who were missing since Saturday .
in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old claimed to have killed the youths and threw their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police shared on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is deemed to have been susp@@ icious , who , according to the statement , led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home on the eve of an autumn festival visit in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first launched personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of respon@@ dents in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ rator led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police interro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disclosure of the circumstances of the act should bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gap
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid homes .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the Association of Con@@ fir@@ mary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes into being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
this means that 14@@ 0.000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live in an initial reception after the first three months of their stay .
many then stum@@ ble upon the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which is growing every year from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 units were missing in the metro@@ politan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many of the working people lived in large cities not@@ ge@@ ously in flat @-@ room rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the loud noise on the flat market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has sun@@ k again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing .
thus , the income tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , attractive fiscal depreci@@ ation opportunities are required , according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , at € 18@@ 4 million on Monday evening , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have already been rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free admission : Croatia and Slovenia serve up a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no passing through , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit of transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the killing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws that came into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most tribal reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus as well as with taxis to the Serbian border city of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter borders .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines out of the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after Hungary , however , after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 injured people .
shortly before the door closes on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws allow the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south @-@ hung@@ arian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced .
prisoners were sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly arranged &quot; transit zones &quot; in total 94 , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke near the &quot; Tran@@ sit@@ zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left by the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers have been broken down and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria achieves only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government information .
in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with vac@@ ancies , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had unexpectedly dis@@ continued rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the br@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
in the past , we have once em@@ o@@ iled the unexpected guests , with a break and drinks .
we said right away , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in an O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man was not allowed to make a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening the str@@ anded train passengers switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u in order to get there after the announcement that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still to try across the border .
the regional train , however , was de@@ posed to the Inn before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday closed a two @-@ leg course on Sunday , organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of ai@@ ding R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our federal chan@@ cell@@ or has publicly and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the mi@@ sts of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to state that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed them , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge , in view of the ongoing floods and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 hi@@ ber@@ nation quarters
Konrad has to do all his hands with refugee support .
Christian Konrad became accustomed to his word &apos;s weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 lod@@ gings in the last year .
to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 shall provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the local tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him to create quarters even for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born . it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also sets great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that trans@@ mit@@ ters have to maintain a certain height of the Shel@@ ter Hol@@ der or the size of the harmon@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful with his experience .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not speak un@@ truth without further into the face .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause any costs of the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , our own quest for districts has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to host refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city chief is committed to distributing refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday em@@ bodies further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
the asylum seekers , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the German action for P@@ ühr@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the General Ren@@ ov@@ ation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try them to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the Arctic
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to de@@ fer the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she gained a new business local .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are worth 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has been laid by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women get into rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is recycled .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the for@@ s@@ aken ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself to be alien@@ ated , re@@ tur@@ ne@@ es journalists , or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
the New Yorker with the fo@@ eh@@ air hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 inhabitants are related to him via -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native @-@ born K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also in word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of his heart .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accidentally loud the nick@@ name that K@@ all@@ stadt got around , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a gold dig@@ ger in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first plots in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not receive Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had explained to the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a native tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so bur@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension wife Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz came up with a visit to the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the say in the US at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA w@@ akes interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no large shifts in Today &apos;s evaluations .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the board didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five main cities , compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 33@@ ,000 ) , but his number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August , today , Today , Today , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was off .
so far in September , sunrise aver@@ aging 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these dawn workers more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ fo@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle on New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could perform a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL fam@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ 6,000 viewers .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia received 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour reached 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will finally prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ shoot the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly unknow@@ ingly obviously who wins the Bachelor &apos;s degree .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally ended up in The Bachelor , was envel@@ oped by the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips locked up to the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bachel@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly named both - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and notic@@ ing ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , she was enig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s degree will be broadcast to ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ key as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League @-@ convert at his first pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and Hay@@ nes gave the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a po@@ orer start in his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens once , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ nes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at that time in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free elec@@ tors demand the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Not@@ ation in Groß@@ glo@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not new teachers according to new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to prevent the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get vacc@@ inations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Free Cho@@ ices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land Conference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as it existed during the Yugosla@@ v war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ eur chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push off the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need national standard federal standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the city wall should not fall under the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many years of continuous cra@@ ck@@ ling remains on the agenda : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Middle Level plus &quot; in which an extension of the upper secondary school will be tested for three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to reach the secondary school .

4 people killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police poured rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ iah , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu P@@ ash@@ al D@@ hak@@ al , senior regional official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police have deployed tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently producing such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces that are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were engaged in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator ha@@ sten@@ ed the process of the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter surface .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is no specific offer yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor should be questioned is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building being demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement at the Small Se@@ as near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure activities
for months , closed doors were negotiated , greeted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement at the Small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Council of the Council of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ nik went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the project , which is around ten to twelve million euros , has been under discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine land@@ owners , who had come to the meeting , highlighted the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of sea bu@@ ds and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge log that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as many other project critics that traffic would increase strongly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come to expect this to happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well @-@ a @-@ hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling @-@ raising campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an unusually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many dark rail and bus far@@ es were part of our journey , hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately look for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Commit@@ tees , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many were also fle@@ eing from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c screening - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily obes@@ e .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this surgery dropped from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes burden decreased and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in one percent and in some cases at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored blood glucose levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c reflecting blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality rate in five years , according to the guiding researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ vit@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater dec@@ lines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for individuals with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have to wait too long to make people take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so even in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel may well be of interest to H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama talked the problem of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama commen@@ ded Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September , and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States followed a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase in intake of hand dis@@ infection by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic san@@ iti@@ zing agents , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of proceeds of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children were deliberately drinking dis@@ infection products , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially in young children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the broad@@ caster Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently acquired four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry by hand dis@@ infection in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is deemed dr@@ unken by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ings Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ut@@ ched her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors exc@@ used them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection books and store de@@ dis@@ infection products out of the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing the disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gem@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police examined the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and demonstrated disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football will be bored by Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ amps to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ year @-@ old was followed by Aber@@ deen , who now clearly stand at the top of the table with five point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that just like that - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ chy in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ chy if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ eus Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s executive board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the decline must end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son &apos;s trust in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ ben , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ attractive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es admitted that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton , to see a seventh consecutive League Vic@@ tory , which gave them a gap of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in po@@ di@@ ums or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while the UK is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
the unemployment rate of Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was below the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as the figures for the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland coinci@@ ded with 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken anno@@ yed the course
since security personnel could not make peace , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials were able to take the stor@@ ks into custody .
a breath alcohol test showed 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le at a 16 @-@ year @-@ old .
the adolescents got picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 pros and stayed initially in custody .
why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being put to death .
when it happens , and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation already took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to view exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications than places available , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to 5 .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed me to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a Repor@@ ters by Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters who can turn to it .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying of unnecessary death .
man to chase a wet police car chase to get out of the c@@ anning river
the c@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him sof@@ tly to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the c@@ anning river .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter Moo@@ dy says ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria attempted to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he went to the Ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media said he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s positive cobal@@ t probe which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the pion@@ age charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at one time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted shoulders , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , Moo@@ dy had posted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy to rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly fashion and perhaps makes people outside coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there think I &apos;m there .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying is now making them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been established with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting Cob@@ alt investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s side , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mis@@ er@@ ably put mud on my leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also the same on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested for driver cur@@ ses
the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram on the weekend .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the car drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia of the police appeared in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy op@@ ts against ri@@ vals for claims about ring games
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zes Tac@@ kling his players as the &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; ring games &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made an almost disgu@@ sted note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him confident , as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring games when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ onic to a real focus and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny already , as this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his type of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the match Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks done and don &apos;t miss any points ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a lifetime sentence due to his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life imprisonment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the Law@@ yer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been from a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of flight from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the declarations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his austr@@ ali@@ an and his Ser@@ b passport , reports to the police every day and keeps himself at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab ri@@ ps apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site .
the third driver re@@ marked it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident site tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone from girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the phone of the girl when this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used words for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that searches were carried out on the computer from him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the act of Indi@@ ct@@ ment to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions and not appear before court on 24 March of this year .
defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael has postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navigate to small border cross@@ ings to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot;
more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left people with fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn county .
they had reached the German side on foot over bridges and wei@@ rs .
there they are welcomed by the Federal Police and for@@ warded to the registration .
in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again met with much more refugees .
some 700 people had arrived in the capital city alone until 8 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tropical storm expected in the southwest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm marine air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart shared .
the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; who had been dra@@ gged across the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , in the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the Lake Con@@ stance , DW@@ D can count on bends from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
the sun shines longer on Friday .
the masses are making it : every two years the autom@@ akers at the IA@@ A show their innovations .
2015 is mainly to be seen in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
the compact class cars are currently in high demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Office of the German Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) alone .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days from 17 to 27 September ) .
a lot of new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at dealers in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel offers a start @-@ up under the biggest competitor VW Golf , which will start at 17@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra will cost from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , Hessen also offers additional diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door Astra .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will be new compact cars next to the Astra on the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra line Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade show , Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes early next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is brand new in the segment .
the Nissan stop wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer &apos;s data at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
out@@ war@@ dly , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger appe@@ aled first and foremost to the front panel : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time , Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of over@@ hau@@ ls and new variants such as the upgraded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial enforcement agency Te@@ gel , who had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , has meanwhile been on his free foot , has been transferred to a larger cell .
his position in office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ testing there .

chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , a compensation for compensation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ing the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
they only spoke a prisoner &apos;s compensation in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 a decent housing .
the Pla@@ inti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged in a homo@@ geneous cell between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also entered head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore constantly locked up for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to fights it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young ones , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to statements by the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to statements by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what happens in Germany .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Buil@@ dings ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it was built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 housing apartments fall out of the rental price bond , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister for Education Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from now 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing per year would have to be built and for this the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investing in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung ) , it is estimated that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in Germany in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Rei@@ än@@ hardt .
according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognition of labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years ago , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , there has been a majority of points of view that refugees should be enabled more quickly to access the labour market .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
until now there is still no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the building of networks is the royal road to integration .
the Berlin school administration has found out that only a few fle@@ dged parents put their children into the put@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ bed parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ ha@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ bills in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators increases strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state has forbidden asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , cur@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) , but now he has given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or ac@@ qui@@ escence do not receive services according to the asylum seekers &apos; performance law more when they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ yst@@ er@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ o@@ g@@ legitimate persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is reduced to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this financing gap must also be closed , &quot; says Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g right away .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually sweep the same rights as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ church right to a new state @-@ religions @-@ relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , taking care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
duties also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes prepar@@ edness to prevail against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to viol@@ ate such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination centre and a general equality law since a scar@@ ce decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what immig@@ rant organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and what international treaties such as the anti @-@ racism Convention Germany require , must in the coming years become a reality when the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medi@@ cally care for the refugees that have been expected so far , writes doctor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ - power and capacity , we can do that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be invested in the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
achievements could later be accounted for by the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to scra@@ pe so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers &apos; performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors make the language barrier above all .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters of interpre@@ ters need to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic eye .
among refugee children there are much more un@@ processed disabilities , and the young people go to education with HIV .
with the partially remaining pictures German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the don@@ or , the refugees may even be relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system , and some refugees were even physicians .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill after estim@@ ations of the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boy is trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleeping and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to day@@ dre@@ aming in the arena .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ mit@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current exhibition staging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for fan@@ atics is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e cocktail with cosmop@@ olitan flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst .
50 cities on the 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus programme convin@@ ces by talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their handi@@ craft .
with the hero of the silent films it wants to easily record the Cuban duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
in addition to numerous Sal@@ mon Sal@@ vation , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks fascinated by the act of t@@ act and agi@@ lity .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
sn@@ akes fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with its mobility .
sixty employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the top priority : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid JU@@ M@@ BO , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst Family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in a nest and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if there are five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are there with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances daily from 17 to 20 September .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread about social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by claims made by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
in the past month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the members of Parliament concerned that immunity ends in parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to expand 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; says Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously unt@@ apped , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; said an explanation by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in the 1930s to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was called the birth@@ place of Sili@@ con Valley .
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that tight @-@ focused companies perform better performance .
arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and when his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four matches for England , and in view of his history , his involvement in the European Championship is certainly uncertain in the next summer .
the big shame on this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last in the injury rate during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a reasonable period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to move through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m Campa@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) proclaimed the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that men are stopping to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often stop to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide , really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone can also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 Epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
Angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani were on track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in Group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but to improve on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö Defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a heavy opponent lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps @-@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some bad pas@@ sports and bad conclusions , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in no less than five attempts , and then abandoned after having used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shoot that was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth season op@@ ener after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had spotted a lef@@ tist flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gateway at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the skill games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola returned to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the engagement of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion league champion , two times Club World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already standing in Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back then Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is now working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Gu@@ ardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ting the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives and emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the lin@@ eup of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said .
the only black person , and she is a nun beaten by her white h@@ ind .
the producer of Dear White People switched to the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed anger at the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved country @-@ wide impact and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , the leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a group of hate .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a group of love , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sport climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all the steps of its obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard fought victory , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isaac Email said ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
so suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not get any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ ars a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ - The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers have been reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but this part played perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ iled a chance to climb within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Pur@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go completely concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger j@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swept over the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three lap in the rear at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton closed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed the Wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer , Miguel S@@ ano , who left the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen made the third ba@@ z@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was the 27th consecutive time in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe clin@@ ched a double play
when Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed person stab@@ bed S@@ ano for his fifth save on three Pit@@ ches .
Detroit prof@@ ited to the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three rings in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I set off and felt I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z secured his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third ba@@ z@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tiger laid in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mo@@ li@@ tor .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning , before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strokes .
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the Wur@@ f@@ schul@@ er .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August because of a shoulder @-@ tie , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to launch the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people of Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
counting from 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be accommod@@ ated there temporarily .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
over the past ten days , according to the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have arranged emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective distra@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
in Germany , too , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
on Tuesday evening Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared that no one will be sent back to Hungary on Tuesday evening .
nor did Germany send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call specific numbers and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann have requested a special summit next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common procedure in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers will want to take a new trial for the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , &quot; said Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed shelter would also be embarrass@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now overcome a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to shut down the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from going through Romania , Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had a@@ verages the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of other migrants were on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ ells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stag@@ ger@@ ed slightly on its orbit around the ring @-@ plan@@ ks .
although this exchange rate is only small , but still too large for a solid , solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered iron volcan@@ oes at the Satur@@ n@@ monds South Pole , which sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing in Munich several weeks
the 1860 München had to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected for four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a loss of heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director of Sports N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper looking at the potential commitment of a un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;

no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar , mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying Man@@ gos don &apos;t have to be too soft or too strong and smell pleasantly .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

last year U@@ PS extended its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 people .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for Christmas business since last year .

first fo@@ eh@@ ement , then striking cold front
this coming night breaks through the valleys of the Alp@@ in@@ ord side of the F@@ öhn through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland shared on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows with storm strength through the middle valleys .
after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n bla@@ sts until Thursday morning in the middle valleys with goats from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance in point to the adjacent center and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture at the mountain@@ side starts to st@@ ow away .
here rain starts , which stops until Thursday evening .
in total , over the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be expected , which has already fallen in large amounts of rain over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn winds out the air , as a result a cold front with strong , partly twisted rain from west to east via Switzerland is rolling .
together with the cold front , the wind re@@ fres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go back significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south however it becomes sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Luther &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a rotten sin @-@ ba@@ bel .
according to historians his negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then introduced the split of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his thesis against the aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated scrip@@ tural texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 pictures formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; around three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that are dedicated to topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ therhood .
as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing company with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Edi@@ tors with its focus on art books .
and this is especially the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into current relationships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into today &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
finally , emotions were at all a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work this up , so that I may be able to bear with the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to give the art more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterised today by advertising , and that is loud .
symbo@@ lis@@ m is being displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I &apos;m a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and feel what strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he gra@@ bs life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to completely capture the Bible , but chosen the themes which are important to him , including mysterious themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway seam
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds mod@@ elled for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration led to a mess , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railroad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill scre@@ ened up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 ; the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is interested in getting a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. Ö@@ du@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must put politics into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the si@@ delines of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ liga support this program as well .
already this weekend the 36 profil@@ ers put a clear sign on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama comes to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football fans , no , we have to use our bla@@ sting power , our influence and our ways to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; prominent feature of the league . &quot;
the Women &apos;s National Team invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensed companies had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , the Association provides 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees in this and the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already sum@@ mon@@ ed the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the Chief of Staff of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye with a fall in early July .
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ shed , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out into the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen twe@@ aked an appropriate photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .

constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Number of result : 1 )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its stem position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change to the goal keeper &apos;s position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of tribal lady Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is training at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if it is possible to use wil@@ ds in the future in all Europa League matches , Tu@@ chel let it be open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final campaign for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , keeps the middle field player Julian Wei@@ gl as understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany will be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IA@@ A fair in a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which are also coming together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being developed on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use around the world to lift the permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
moreover , the German government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
automated driving increasingly takes over the car , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at its location in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly explained .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical of self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Inves@@ tig@@ ations Dek@@ ra is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France 21 per cent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed by 20@@ 25 are reck@@ oned with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give the control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , at least 15 percent could be expected in flowing traffic , in traffic jams 45 percent .
well each fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at ping @-@ p@@ ong @-@ EM
at present , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf wants to only hit singles with the title battles of 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor appointment in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the setting up in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should focus on it , &quot; explained the fifth fifth .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
on Wednesday in Munich , the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I was the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition sounded a little bit like death for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one gets to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely opa@@ que work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed whole artwork for which much effort has been done : to indulge in the d@@ olls , a sty@@ list has been hired for example .
the makers have bar@@ red 14 tons of material according to the dict@@ ator Thierry - Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught fashion to develop fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener lace as fashion @-@ niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working on its own , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en j@@ okes .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role and was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now being re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewellery , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans against past pen@@ cils , is an increasing order potential .
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already have half of all orders .
j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en together with nine other companies is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und embroi@@ dery .
only they can wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private speciality stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports weak@@ en , currently in Russia and in the US .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer talks about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have been introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable products . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graduate engineer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
in the process , the machine shr@@ inks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took the inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; you should not touch legends , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI aims to open the economy wider to the world
the economy has to open wide out@@ war@@ dly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents &quot; reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and open the market more open , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open government @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier .
to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and to mi@@ tig@@ ate consumers with a significantly higher dose of the toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch explained .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of catches can not be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible .
in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p mostly are so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in cl@@ oning is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is concentrated on the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of damage could cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its website with respect to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet with the Green Party member Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount emit@@ ted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and sur@@ passed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
