the organization carries out documents from which any transfer and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures on the given core material .
should any core material be used in accordance with this agreement , in case of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organization agrees with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures in accordance with this agreement can be terminated in relation to this material .
II ) That during the period of non @-@ application of the safegu@@ ards , the material will not be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .
B ) The organisation and the community shall make a provision that the safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
as far as possible , the regulation will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied .
in any case , the security measures envis@@ aged in the Convention will be re@@ applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear operation .
the organization is kept on the current account of the total amount and composition of the material contained in the respective state or the relevant states and on any transfer of such material from this state or to these states .
this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural requirements and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a hidden knowledge of the military activity , and does not apply to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons subject to their jurisdiction are created , but extraordinary costs due to a particular endeav@@ or of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs if it has been clari@@ fied beforehand .
in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Agreement in the same way as to the nationals of the States .
any claim that the community or the state vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the community or the state for damages , with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , which arose out of the implementation of the security measures in accordance with this agreement , is governed in accordance with international law .
after checking the relevant relevant information presented by the Director General , the organisation shall not be able to verify that no core material , which must be subject to securing measures after this agreement , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II para C of the Stat@@ ute and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the measures taken by the measures applied , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , the community or the state , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Agreement shall be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the state concerned to take part in the discussion of such issues by the Council .
with the exception of disputes concluded by the Council after article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement are to be attached to an arbit@@ ration court on request of a party , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators designated as arbitr@@ ators select a fifth to assume the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the application for an arbit@@ ration , the community or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ration court are competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding on the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This agreement shall be concluded for non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the Treaty , and become members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant State of the Organisation noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Agreement and
II ) When the community of the organisation noti@@ fies that it is capable of applying its safegu@@ ards in relation to this state for the purposes of this convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other upon request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this agreement .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the States .
C ) The General Director immediately instruc@@ ts all Member States of the Organization from any change in the Convention .
a ) The Convention enters into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States receives written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This agreement will remain in force for so long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Agreement is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required .
the aim of the methods of securing measures set in this agreement is timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant quantities of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a distributing by the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial integration and monitoring as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material account zone the quantity of material that has not been proven for a certain period is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified seas .
in carrying out their follow @-@ up checks , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material account zones .
in the application of their safegu@@ ards , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are determined and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , produced , str@@ anded , lost , lost or otherwise known nuclear material and stock levels ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedure for determining , checking and evaluating devi@@ ations in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) Proced@@ ure for the assessment of accumulation of non @-@ measured invent@@ ories and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that identifies the core material inventory and the changes in the material account area for each material account zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material account zone ;
( g ) provisions that ensure that accounting practices and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the organisation in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures based on this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore processing .
B ) will introduce ur@@ anium or th@@ orium content , which the phase of the core fuel cycle described in letter c ) has not yet reached , into the States , so the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves the core material suitable for the production and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced to the states in a later stage of the core fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are terminated for core materials under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to security measures based on the agreement , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so the organization and the community consult each other through the application of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention will be terminated for core materials under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are con@@ sent@@ ing to the fact that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the community , the organization releases the following core material from the safegu@@ ards following this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ si@@ le material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization of nuclear materials , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures in accordance with the agreement , exemp@@ ts from these safegu@@ ards provided the total material quantity freed from this article in the states is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilograms of particular p@@ alli@@ ble material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium enrich@@ ing more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium enrich@@ ing 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should a liberated core material be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on the material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures established in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without alter@@ ing this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this deadline requires the incorpor@@ ation between the organization , the community and the States .
on the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation presents a summ@@ arized inventory of the entire nuclear material contained in this convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries on this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
in awakening GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC decided to contribute to the special program set by international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by common resource schedul@@ ing problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the agreement entered into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed carrying out and administration of this agreement and the central b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table in which it intends to use the criteria defined in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; special transaction &quot; which consists of the funds the Member States will contribute to the special transaction in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to and used by the Organization as the administrator , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction accounts are led separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or un@@ paid debts of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited in the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator of the time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach member state may be able to make payments before the dates mentioned above .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organisation , the Administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school &apos;s notes to cover the expenditure for the transaction loan and to balance the transaction accounts in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the E@@ EC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit absorption capacity to loan terms without any discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be governed by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly @-@ paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is assessed , approved and managed for the loan program of the organization according to the procedures and practices that are to be taken into account for the stated purpose of the acc@@ ru@@ al to the agreement stated in the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by a loan or a loan for a program or project which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free @-@ years , they are re@@ payable in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay this clock are directly to the organization that retains it .
each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given in particular .
the revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the car@@ et@@ aker defined at the time of the loan granted , could be the recipient of a special transaction loan .
re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible .
until the full allocation of all the special transaction loans , the administrator instruc@@ ts the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors .
during the time of the payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator instruc@@ ts the E@@ EC annually on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this purpose .
as soon as possible , the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction accounts with a statement by the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall soon send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are evident .
the E@@ EC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to do this , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to complete the means of the special transaction account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the Organisation if necessary , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due .
if the total amount of capital received from the benefici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural requirements of each party .
the governments of the Member States are notified to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat carries out these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows on the day of receipt of the mentioned specifications in the organization .
this agreement is composed in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter change to the amend@@ ment of Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT shall issue the following OR@@ D@@ IC@@ TION :

I ask you to confirm the approval of the community for these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government at the time standing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government at the time standing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobil@@ isation of Member States &apos; claims under the medium @-@ term financial support
the B@@ IS could close a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks have a corresponding proposal .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of CHF 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of the member countries .
even now , however , some terms are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ Z would be prepared .
in each stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extending extensions without the need for a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as in their possible extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening vision .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawings were not made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the draws would take place in the B@@ IS at the conclusion of the agreement at the disposal of currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the B@@ IS applied at the time to under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the B@@ IS needs to be able to obtain the required funds on the market , then the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum equivalent to the margin increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you gave me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks have a corresponding proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you gave me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am honored to give you the approval of the Council of the European Communities on the content of this letter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the fact that the Convention on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) entered into force on 16 March 1983 , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the awareness of the importance of the &quot; program on cooperation in measuring and evaluating the vast transfer of air @-@ poll@@ uting substances in Europe &quot; ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; E@@ MEP &quot; ) in the awareness of the significance of the &quot; program on cooperation in measuring and evaluating the vast transfer of air @-@ contaminated substances in Europe &quot; ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; E@@ MEP &quot; ) ,
recognizing the fact that the implementation of the E@@ MEP has so far been made possible thanks to the financial means provided by the UN Environment Programme and the voluntary contributions of governments ,
knowing the fact that the contribution of the UN environmental programme is only done by the end of 1984 and this contribution as well as the voluntary contributions of governments do not fully cover the costs of the application of the Employment Plan@@ ner of the E@@ MEP , so that precau@@ tions must be taken to ensure the long @-@ term financing after 1984 ,
in view of the demands addressed by the Economic Commission for Europe in its decision B ( XX@@ XVI@@ II ) to the governments of the Member States of the E@@ EC , in which these mod@@ alities shall be sought in accordance with the mod@@ alities stated in the first meeting of the executive committee of the Convention ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Non @-@ uti@@ man@@ gan@@ ization &quot; ) , which require the so @-@ called organ for the successful implementation of its activities , in particular those relating to the works of the MEP ,
bearing in mind that the Convention has no provision on the financing of the MEP and it is therefore necessary to make suitable arrangements on this subject ,

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appar@@ itions may not appear : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by re@@ di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on slides , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time of standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ al@@ ysts which are observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix in a series where micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International Standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tible Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard prepar@@ atory or a State Nor@@ mal preparation in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative nar@@ ration of the International Standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to the label is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying on phosphor@@ us pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to meet the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ plen@@ ished serum .
re@@ agents , whether in a fluid form or after dissolution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood group determination destined for international exchange should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has reached a unified system .
re@@ agents to blood group determination can be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent being located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer laboratory has written records about all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents are so long stored by the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
on each individual container you can place a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity , or , of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed to replace ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers , contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity , or , of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re @-@ liqui@@ dation ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the system to this protocol .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected group B people immune from red blood cells or by specific group A substances .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . there are no human red blood cells that contain no A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups 0 and B .

it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by Anti @-@ A serum from group B blood don@@ ors ) .
an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a corresponding comparative par@@ ate , separately against flooding of A1 and A2 blood cells to ti@@ tr@@ ate .
in addition , it is parallel to the un@@ dil@@ uted , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative compar@@ ate against a flow of B @-@ blood cells to ti@@ tr@@ ate .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily identifiable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of A1 and A2 blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempts are performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two species , which differ by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is reached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ completely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as bo@@ vine serum or using other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ ination on slides are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are em@@ itted in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may possibly be altered if international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ized by the tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 versus C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , serum is to react with blood cells containing do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for the use of object bear@@ ers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ized by the ag@@ glut@@ inous C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with flooding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
these Ser@@ a are therefore only specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the blood cells tested are em@@ itted in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
the ti@@ ter of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis c@@ c@@ d@@ dee &apos;s blood cells .

anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the Test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and must not be included in any form anti @-@ D ) must have visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity of anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time , under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum is intended to be used on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the anti @-@ inflammatory antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ized by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ ination no human red blood cells containing no A an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .

anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ ination no human red blood cells containing no B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding comparative approach , to ti@@ tr@@ ate the group B blood cells ( 1 ) .
if Anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % fl@@ ushing of B @-@ blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity .

in THE realisation that this goal is best achieved by the fact that the shipping procedure currently applied to the transport of goods within the community , between the Community and Austria and Switzerland , as well as between Austria and Switzerland , will be extended to those EF@@ TA countries that do not yet apply this procedure ,
( 1 ) In this agreement , provisions for the promotion of goods between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries are established ; for this purpose , a common shipping procedure is introduced , which is un@@ prejudi@@ ced to the nature and origin of goods that may be re@@ charged , forwarded or stored .
( 2 ) Saf@@ egu@@ arding this Agreement , in particular of its provisions on the performance of the goods , goods transport within the Community shall be carried out as part of the Community mail order procedure .
