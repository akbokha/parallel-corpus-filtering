<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Agreement is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures as required.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the methods of securing measures set in this agreement is timely discovery of the turnoff of significant quantities of nuclear weapons for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes, as well as the deterrence of such a distributing by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target specified in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with the spatial integration and monitoring as important complementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation, in which for each material account zone the quantity of material that has not been proven for a certain period is specified by specifying the accuracy limits for the specified seas.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their follow-up checks, the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material account zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their safeguards, the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and, as far as necessary, envisage how they are determined and useful in the supplemental agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved, produced, stranded, lost, lost or otherwise known nuclear material and stock levels;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) procedure for determining, checking and evaluating deviations in the measurements of transmitters and receivers;</seg>
<seg id="705">E) Procedure for the assessment of accumulation of non-measured inventories and non-measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol and reporting system that identifies the core material inventory and the changes in the material account area for each material account zone, including the inputs and outputs of the material account zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">(g) provisions that ensure that accounting practices and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Procedure for reporting to the organisation in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures based on this agreement do not cover material in mining or ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) will introduce uranium or thorium content, which the phase of the core fuel cycle described in letter c) has not yet reached, into the States, so the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not implemented for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves the core material suitable for the production and purity of fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced to the states in a later stage of the core fuel circuit, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The safeguards provided in this Convention are terminated for core materials under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. however, the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material, which is subject to security measures based on the agreement, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so the organization and the community consult each other through the application of appropriate safeguards.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguards provided in this Convention will be terminated for core materials under the conditions mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community are consenting to the fact that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">Upon request of the community, the organization releases the following core material from the safeguards following this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in gram or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Core material if it is used in non-nuclear activities after Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with an isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the Community, the organization of nuclear materials, which would otherwise be subject to securing measures in accordance with the agreement, exempts from these safeguards provided the total material quantity freed from this article in the states is at no time more than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilograms of particular pallible material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) Uran with enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplication of his weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) Uran with enrichment, which lies under 0.2 (20%) and above the natural uranium, is calculated by multiplication of his weight with the fivefold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium enriching more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) 20 metric tons of depleted uranium enriching 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should a liberated core material be processed or stored together with the core material, which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this agreement, precautions are made for the re-application of the securing measures on the material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements, which are necessary in the scope, which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention, in detail how to apply the procedures established in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without altering this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this deadline requires the incorporation between the organization, the community and the States.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report mentioned in Article 62, the organisation presents a summarized inventory of the entire nuclear material contained in this convention in the States, regardless of its origin, and carries on this inventory of inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">In awakening GRÃNDE - a) The EEC decided to contribute to the special program set by international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hampered by common resource scheduling problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the agreement entered into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed carrying out and administration of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table in which it intends to use the criteria defined in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "special transaction" which consists of the funds the Member States will contribute to the special transaction in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to and used by the Organization as the administrator, and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction accounts are led separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or unpaid debts of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited in the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment shall be made in two instalments (i) the first amounting to at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrator of the time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each member state may be able to make payments before the dates mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organisation, the Administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the school's notes to cover the expenditure for the transaction loan and to balance the transaction accounts in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">(III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further credit absorption capacity to loan terms without any discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly-paid development program or project (including a sectoral project), which is assessed, approved and managed for the loan program of the organization according to the procedures and practices that are to be taken into account for the stated purpose of the accrual to the agreement stated in the letter b) of the preamble.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of regular means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound by a loan or a loan for a program or project which has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the organization; thus, in ten free-years, they are repayable in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay this clock are directly to the organization that retains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is given in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">The revenue from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are established or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which are members of the organization and which, according to what the caretaker defined at the time of the loan granted, could be the recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until the full allocation of all the special transaction loans, the administrator instructs the EEC on the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator instructs the EEC annually on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditures made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement of the special transaction accounts with a statement by the external auditors of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC shall soon send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the repayments to the Member States are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrators work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To do this, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator to complete the means of the special transaction account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation if necessary, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital received from the beneficiaries is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural requirements of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States are notified to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned.</seg>

<seg id="1868">Based on the joint statement adopted by the ministers of the EFTA countries and the Member States of the Community as well as by the Commission of the European Communities on 9 April 1984 in Luxembourg, which includes a call for the creation of a European Economic Area, in particular with regard to simplification of border uniformity and the rules of origin,</seg>
<seg id="1869">Based on the agreement concluded between EFTA countries and the Community to simplify the transport of goods in goods transport, with which a uniform administration paper is introduced for this trade.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In THE realisation that the use of this single document, which is applied as part of a common shipping method for the transport of goods between the Community and EFTA countries as well as between the individual EFTA countries, would make a simplification,</seg>
<seg id="1871">In THE realisation that this goal is best achieved by the fact that the shipping procedure currently applied to the transport of goods within the community, between the Community and Austria and Switzerland, as well as between Austria and Switzerland, will be extended to those EFTA countries that do not yet apply this procedure,</seg>
<seg id="1872">(1) In this agreement, provisions for the promotion of goods between the Community and EFTA countries as well as between the individual EFTA countries are established; for this purpose, a common shipping procedure is introduced, which is unprejudiced to the nature and origin of goods that may be recharged, forwarded or stored.</seg>

<seg id="1897">(2) If such goods have been transferred from an EFTA country in which they have been transferred to another customs procedure than a shipping method or customs procedures, the T 2 procedure must not be applied.</seg>
