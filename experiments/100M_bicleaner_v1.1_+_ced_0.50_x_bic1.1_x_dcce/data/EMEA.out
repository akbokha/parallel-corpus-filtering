this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. chaotic thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which the patients have altern@@ ating periods of normal mood altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
for both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears above all as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo for preventing recur@@ rence , to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to those of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melt tablets and the solution to absorb ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness compared to patients receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to intake ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) include extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disturbances ( un@@ controlled growth ) , trem@@ ors , nausea , vom@@ iting , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were referring to the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of the injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company , Ot@@ ta@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd , to appro@@ ve Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients displaying predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , once daily , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
Abi@@ li@@ fy &apos;s efficacy in treating schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after replacement of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of su@@ ici@@ dal with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , consider reducing the dose or breaking down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing towards a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis who are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had an increased risk of death vis @-@ à @-@ vis the placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; poor &quot; ( = poor &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibited with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected to increase with a moderate rise in Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole each day showed no significant effect on the metabol@@ ism@@ of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ or@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data set for safety in humans and concerns that arise in animal reproductive studies , this drug may not be used during pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , a total lesser incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia was compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ tian therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients receiving Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ a pra@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ A , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the administration of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ amen .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the respon@@ dents held a response to the study medi@@ tate were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions@@ rate Scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole significantly reduced the rate of return at 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo over superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono @-@ therapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole presented no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and an accounting effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ ising phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar fall , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average age of eli@@ oration is about 75 hours for Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ised metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in poor &quot; poor &quot; ( = poor poor ) metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients find no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the effect of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the potential carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no relevance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 .
however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the Sul@@ ph@@ ate Con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can alternatively take tablet tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders have been reported in some cases after the beginning or after replacement of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , independent of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected to increase with a moderate rise in Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mono @-@ therapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole presented no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form for healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile of apes after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean Ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used to quickly control as@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced using the oral application of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ v@@ ection of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking account of the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an oral treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with as@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arising during the treatment with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater than that of the sole application of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers used Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole , however this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &quot; poor &quot; ( = poor &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting up the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of the sole application of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see paragraph 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see paragraph 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was statisti@@ cally significant greater enh@@ ancements of as@@ gi@@ ety / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ gi@@ ance and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean recovery from bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe as@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the total population , but a statistical significance was noted due to a decreased patient number .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of the respon@@ dents held a response to the study medi@@ tate were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ rate Scale , showed a significantly greater improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the rate of return , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of six weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ ising phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole presented himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar fall , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection the AU@@ C is 90 % greater the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time was applied until the maximum plasma level was reached in 1 to 3 hours .
the gift of Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated exposure to systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .
in studies on the reproduction toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns resulted in mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rabbit ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no relevance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in al@@ mon@@ otherapy and mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the treatment of a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were able to respond to treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
only patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time were seen in terms of the efficacy indi@@ ces such as time to the deterioration of the disease and their survival , no difference between the drugs .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be applied to patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ene numbers in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel , it was not necessary to be given other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ers &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
for sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose changes in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel with a significant other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
no re@@ my@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in patients until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
while a ambig@@ u@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac events in the indicated patient &apos;s collective are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ tial means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a blocking account , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and major incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated at a pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most notable important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows side effects associated with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain@@ less gum , loose stool , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , ul@@ cers in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ is@@ ub@@ ules compound that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to a blocking of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ doc@@ epitheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ in receptor and , based on the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic line in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two one @-@ arm non @-@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes at a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ meditation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ az@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First Line Therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous application of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase way .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or tissue engagement of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was also higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is metabol@@ ised primarily to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine elimination was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and above all light @-@ protected over 8 hours .

Abra@@ x@@ ane is used for treatment of breast cancer when other therapies have been tried but not successful , and if you are not eligible for anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies .
Abra@@ x@@ anes should not be used : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pac@@ lit@@ axel or any of the other parts of Abra@@ x@@ ane • If your white blood cells are low ( source values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you about it )
special caution when applying Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have impaired ren@@ al function • if you suffer from feeling num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • if you have heart problems
please inform the doctor if you apply other medicines or have used recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs , as these may possibly have an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in addition , they should be advised prior to treatment via a blocking account , since the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment gives the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood protein values in which blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for whom the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood screening , Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thropo@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before being either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study evaluating the effects of screening stre@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion .
stre@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
stre@@ et@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems since further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the European Union regulations , the drug has demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the import of se@@ amed across the European Union .
an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where there is a risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger operative interventions that require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , stre@@ et@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an anticipated blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
because of the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or under the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical findings suggest that patients with a very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may be different depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
given this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction rate of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reaction rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the quantity of antibodies by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgical procedure .
the iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - a large amount of iron reserves are available prior to the start of the stre@@ et@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgical procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medication into the circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ec@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ ils ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ omer to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , the reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the maximum limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in Section 4.2 .
increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed in clinical studies when ery@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit resulting from the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ denti@@ ary coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the maximum limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for the evaluation of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thropo@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations were targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in @-@ vitro examinations of tumour tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , vascular thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common adverse effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients undergoing an@@ thropo@@ genic treatment .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lica and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content is identical to the endo@@ genous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ emia patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thropo@@ genesis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ og@@ lob@@ oma ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 22 prostate cancer , 21 gastro@@ intestinal cancer and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ mal carcin@@ oma , 260 Bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in .
survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin with an@@ a@@ emia were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to a number of frequent malign@@ ancies , a more un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value under 13 g / dl because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no stimulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with close to 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fat im@@ balances , a delay of the os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fo@@ etal mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro fertili@@ zation with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

before the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the market has to supply the healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Educational brochures • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging items .
the owner of the permit has to ensure that the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application has been set up and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the traffic .
the owner of the approval for the placing on the market agrees to conduct the studies listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in the 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in obtaining new information that may affect the latest safety specification , the drug vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • on request by the E@@ MEA
• You have suffered a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or reinforced breast pain ) • the risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ) occurs - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred in the past .

during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed it may occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells , which is rec@@ eding again in further treatment .
your doctor will carry out regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , resolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the start of the treatment .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ per after mon@@ omer to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bubble con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , it will break down your treatment with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , stre@@ et@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa drugs and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adapt your stre@@ et@@ amed dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past have already occurred thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ( e.g. a deep vein thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that stre@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a major orthop@@ edic surgery , you should check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia prior to treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and be treated accordingly .
if your red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) is too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or with HIV ) .
depending on how your blood type ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor &apos;s doctor will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your physician considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash your stre@@ amed herself under the skin .

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a small frac@@ ture like H@@ inf@@ lingen ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for the evaluation of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years has been studied .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies of a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with the ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients suffering from A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients with A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of the patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients taking placebo ( 139 out of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subjected to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to apply the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in nursing women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When suffering from medical or nursing aid
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently received low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the treatment of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is lacking for safety and efficacy .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an intake of calcium and vitamin D before beginning treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental treatment , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta may be reduced by adding par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cla@@ sta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe adverse events of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased in patients receiving A@@ cla@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction , Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , was associated with kidney function disorders , which were associated with a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cla@@ dic and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the application was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of the placebo @-@ treated patients .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal threshold range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred at 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently received hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported by local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area of one with A@@ cla@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of over@@ dosage , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ et ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid frac@@ tures of A@@ cla@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a lasting effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 % of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , of the total hip by 6.0 % , the lower pel@@ vis by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology for 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic crest .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volume compared to placebo in comparison to placebo and the maintenance of trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mortality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all points of time .
for more than 24 months , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to a 5.@@ 4 % increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo and by 4.3 % on the lower lid .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior compared to the once @-@ weekly application of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate relative to the percentage change of BM@@ D lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 @-@ 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
combined results showed a similar decrease in pain and pain control compared to bas@@ eline and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared to bas@@ eline .
patients who were classified as the six @-@ month main study ( response to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was 141 of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma bar rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α -@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination lasting 1 ½ g 146 hours .
the early di@@ gest@@ ation phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearing is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose , and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clear@@ ance of cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enz@@ ym@@ atic metabolic substances is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ atine clear@@ ances , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine clear@@ ances , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance up to 35 ml / min do not require a dose adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since for severe kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
trials in dogs were administered single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats by intraven@@ ous doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 minutes in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referring to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated items that exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most common complic@@ ation in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats we observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels .

July 2007 , amended on 29 September 2006 , in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Marketing Au@@ thor@@ isation Application , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in the application is in force and works before and during the product .
risk Management Plan The owner of the approval for marketing comm@@ its to conduct the studies and additional activities related to pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , which are set out in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2 of the authorisation application and all following by the CH@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted along with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk . • In the course of 60 days , an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a Sub@@ stance @-@ class agent called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is established un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cla@@ sta works by re @-@ norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , giving the bones strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you are using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken / applied other medicines or have used / applied recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is very important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drink , be sure to take plenty of fluids in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks following the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low during the time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if missed by A@@ cla@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please notice your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the following in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms in yourself after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta .
physical signs due to low cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .
flu , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , ting@@ ling / feeling , drow@@ sin@@ ess , trem@@ ors , transi@@ ent unconscious , taste disorder , diar@@ rho@@ ea , stomach upset , chest pain , redness , redness , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue swelling and thirst .
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or on the ja@@ ws were reported particularly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
over allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice any side effects not listed in this article .
if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently received low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to use the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atically dil@@ uted , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that or several
in addition , four studies were carried out in over 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking cess@@ ation compared to placebo .
the studies on smoking cess@@ ation showed no uniform results , so the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were noted during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others .
caution is advisable with concur@@ rent use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( Medic@@ ines against fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , to@@ bac@@ con@@ az@@ ole or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s efficacy in reducing weight in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the AR@@ Z

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts at up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - besides the obesity of themselves - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown adequately .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not shown .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ph@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl gum or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl / insulin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes more easily adjustable .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in triple therapy was studied ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the addition of acet@@ one to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ph@@ ant in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thal@@ mic ( decreased sensitivity to irritation ) .
Ac@@ tos can neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular out@@ patient trial with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated initial liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , ede@@ ma , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be led by the clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters are preliminary .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which may arise from fat deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a consequence of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral bil@@ ingual or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl gum or as a dual @-@ combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ acr@@ on , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a presence or worsen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the incidence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of messages of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative meditation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be replaced ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and increased the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from available data not appreciated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as seen in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents above thre@@ ef@@ old the upper limit of the standard area were equally common to placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ ph@@ ant .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or respectively .
since the market launch , heart failure was rarely reported in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative media .
over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
at intake of the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it was shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus g@@ lic@@ la@@ gens as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive only insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as marginal , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plastic matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide , and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while reduced values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of over 20 weeks Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ patient trial , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , with top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy in roughly three times the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies show that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the f@@ ences ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma eli@@ oration time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys entered plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible exc@@ entri@@ c cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the reduced insulin resistance of the mother animal under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indications resulted in an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative meditation .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ gens have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both over an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study l@@ acked the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal M@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually used once or twice a day when a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) level , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package insert ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adaptation is required when changing to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a transition from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than previous insulin levels .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask his patients always after other medicines taken by them .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ ct@@ ose in uter@@ o .
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
nervous system diseases Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood glucose control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually rever@@ sible .

diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection point , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur when failed to change the in@@ sti@@ p@@ ation points within the injection area .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral feed of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape pieces , candy , biscuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a single auxiliary sper@@ son or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) sites on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the cle@@ av@@ age is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

aden@@ o@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out notes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger agate deposits that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , pla@@ iting attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients with aden@@ o@@ ic are still taking other medicines to prevent g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es during the first six months .
the drug is not recommended for children and patients who had organ transplan@@ tation as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ o@@ ic do@@ si@@ z@@ ations ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients received 80 mg twice daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day , in the last three measurements a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients were placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre@@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in reducing the ur@@ inary acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also present a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present in the medical history and / or a g@@ out of arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ n@@ wort seed still amounts to &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restrictions ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended .
transplan@@ t recipients Since there are no experiences in transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular Disease In case of isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ containing medicines , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment , because ure@@ a deposits in the tissue can first be mobili@@ zed by lowering the serum sample cone .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine often occurs in rare cases , so that there is a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
during phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ ing treatment and in the further course , depending on clinical findings ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ate mirror ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous addition of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times daily associated with an increase in f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .

An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , ret@@ ards absorption of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and decreases the C@@ MA@@ x reduction by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy Data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not depend on the side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

lowering serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( i.e. .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum concentration in subjects , irrespective of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels of serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) revealed a decrease in the incidence of pla@@ iting sei@@ zur@@ es ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ out node size , which resulted in 54 % of patients complete disappearance of the g@@ out k@@ not until month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration was observed , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data indicating that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cers ) , tum@@ ul@@ tuous abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic upset .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used in o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. to appro@@ ve AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these guidelines to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed by a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , can only be given under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ alen duc@@ ts , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible anti@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be cau@@ tioned that the occurrence of symptoms such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or wor@@ shi@@ ping heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after symptoms which indicate a es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk has been detected , stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a ( including some severe and complications ) have rarely been reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there is no data available indicating whether the de@@ position of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ e- rose of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but will continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , decreases of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ duction of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to a further increased risk of falls and oste@@ opor@@ osis in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D &apos;s asc@@ ents continue to be maintained by the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter ; even the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two pla@@ z@@ ebo@@ at studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new spine by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily spread in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly re@@ distri@@ butes to the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .

Adv@@ anta is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , shorter trials of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined , as Adv@@ ancement in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other constitu@@ ents , Adv@@ anta must not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( in particular some herbal ) drug may be taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the S@@ agra@@ ph dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of advoc@@ acy should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulation ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ paragra@@ phs , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment .
systemic exposure , measured as a valley level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients on day 4 .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks following transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ancement to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ birth phase .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the article dose scheme can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral dosage of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral max@@ illary advance should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral max@@ illary action should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendations - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change@@ over has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation following a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to PRO@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation should commen@@ ce for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ anta , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients - although there is no clinical experience with transplan@@ ted patients - Pro@@ gra@@ f occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood @-@ tal mirrors in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dose adaptation is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potentials of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary tract ) is recommended .
change from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal mirrors .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley review during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king Mir@@ ror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after adjusting Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ ages , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , Chan@@ ges in Immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive Therapy , or concur@@ rent use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ anta is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level in the whole blood is usually in the first time following liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been shown to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
in addition to proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the use of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to avoid other plant remedies during treatment with prec@@ ari@@ al ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ anta .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ burden and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , show symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
as Adv@@ anta &apos;s hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ert , lac@@ tose contain , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ me@@ - blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain the same concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ economics antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal transit .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other pharmaceuticals Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines , which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect their metabolism .
as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduces the clear@@ ances of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and therefore can increase the hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of examinations in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , it is advisable to monitor the new@@ born to any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant is often not determined precisely because of the underlying path@@ ology of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
subsequent side effects are performed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How are known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ k@@ otic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) is often increased .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with advoc@@ acy .
it was reported via ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ isches protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction pathways in the T cell , preventing the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , furthermore the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recent , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , 110 patients were reported , who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was also less frequent in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases diagnosed with bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in comparison to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were surrounded by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute transplan@@ t rejection occurred was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in transplan@@ t patients of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients undergoing a random@@ ised trial of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dosage ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following colon transplan@@ tation demonstrated an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cer@@ eal transplan@@ tations ) .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower starting doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to valley mirrors between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ affiliated group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ anta was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) compared to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley review during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proved to be refrac@@ tory compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart condition , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ burden and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ ent@@ ative Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II caused by con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether or not advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it enables the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of advoc@@ ates in the prevention of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges was evaluated in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new ble@@ ed@@ ings of blood with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ enti@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the placing of lawyers in the whole European Union .
dosage and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat the injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate detection of the factor VI@@ II plasma bar is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve various in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of Factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the condition of the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , where the risk depends on the greatest risk within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ory development , re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product was observed on another , the recur@@ rence of ( low ti@@ tr@@ es ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
AD@@ R@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who all showed a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) was performed in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients aged under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) showed a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ tre against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated from the occurrence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , bru@@ ises , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .

the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre@@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since its launch , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk pro@@ visi@@ oning as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder will apply for another extension process in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited confirmed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the Company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the soft tissues ( tissues that link and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Advent is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and killing cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the lower abdom@@ en area , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment started and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated a standard scale of how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , patients with Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , oral dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be applied to patients suffering from con@@ genital glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiovascular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it , breaking or ch@@ ew ) .
due to the absence of data for safety and efficacy ( see paragraph 5.1 ) , Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ inn@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ inet , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive pills ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment with hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients suffering from cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder retention or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours prior to the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , because anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce it to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , irrespective of whether or not Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely .
in @-@ vitro studies , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ ases .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , nausea , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il @-@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ enz@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flu@@ xes , including the strengthening of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined based on the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences regarding sex , age or ethnic affili@@ ation .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ os@@ ze in healthy volunteers aged 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects deprived of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n badly .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to exposition after administration of an Aer@@ zen tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally related to the ingredient pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rho@@ ea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pains , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of liver inflammation and cases of eye @-@ catching liver values were also rarely reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ml of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impaired sleep and capacity on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease of symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease of the symptom was after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current illness progress and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed again .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during allergy time .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied while taking as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 adolescents aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse effect was head@@ aches ; this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients receiving placebo .
in a multiple dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses given in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c @-@ interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flu@@ xes , including the strengthening of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chron@@ ically I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms despite ae@@ ti@@ ology and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily .
as hi@@ stam@@ ine infection is a caus@@ ative factor for all malign@@ ant diseases , it is expected that , except in chron@@ ically I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of the placebo @-@ treated patients .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant stimulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely eliminated .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the pre @-@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no comparable degree of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n exposure , no quantitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be used independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which is restricted metabolism , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally administered ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study on adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c @-@ interval was observed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at an individual dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents conducted in clinical trials were not impaired by psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol has neither led to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall survival of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which metabol@@ ise restricted metabolism .
the strain ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance @-@ stimulation once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those recommended by adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely .

there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established by adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the reduction formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ enz@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flu@@ xes , including the strengthening of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this ill @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets with as@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or as@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dosage studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
infants from 6 to 23 months of age were the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years has been observed .
in recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .

Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to release A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s approval for the prevention of influenza in adults and older people in June 2008 .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from man to man because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus included in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was dis@@ connected , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognised as a foreign body ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical examination and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ al@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
for children between 4 and 12 years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with un@@ proven levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to the treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gen@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are broken down just as as@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gen@@ ase have the risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weighed over four years compared to the risks .
ast@@ er@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for the placing of A@@ gener@@ a in the whole European Union .
A@@ gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster should be administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ast@@ er@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems at 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be aware that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , cham@@ fer@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ds which are metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ressing the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients who use these drugs at the same time , am@@ per@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high level of propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases in which medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi @-@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 medi@@ ums with low therapeutic width are not given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels containing serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in trying to offset the degra@@ ded plasma levels through a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and stop the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduced when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance is recommended , since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are diver@@ ted at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ines might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ath .
the simultaneous injection of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if clinical reasons are required to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous dosing .
simultaneous use of 700 m@@ g. of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole twice daily led to an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed once a day without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions if they are used together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with ast@@ er@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is recommended that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as ast@@ er@@ ase , as it can cause resor@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can cause a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
simultaneous exposure to as@@ gener@@ ase can increase the plasma concentrations considerably and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test persons , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of a@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect pronounced increase in plasma levels while admini@@ stering as@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma @-@ level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ise the levels is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with the concur@@ rent gift of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , aspir@@ in should not be used together with oral @-@ taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while the use of as@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is recommended .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ Fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous injection of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ast@@ er@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( such as Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be applied only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves into breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of the 12 body weight .
the further development of the offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are related to the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of ag@@ ne@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) which were assessed by investig@@ ators as in connection with the study media and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in people with HIV , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal cervical fat accumulation .
among 113 anti @-@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ cking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ SC 300@@ 6 , patients treated at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular pap@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred normally during the second week of treatment and spontaneously disappeared within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI treated patients who received 600 mg of ag@@ ne@@ ase twice daily together with a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were very common in patients who received ag@@ ne@@ ase along with a low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral ga@@ g and ga@@ g pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r do@@ si@@ z@@ ations - as in other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r brow@@ nish treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates from 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors performed over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes caused by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations of clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for assessing the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossil @-@ resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which A@@ gen@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mostly brow@@ ned with a low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis determined the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ gross threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 of whom were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s arranged together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled had plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children of the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the amount and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active portion is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase Solution and A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram basis .
ren@@ al clear@@ ances of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the impact of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these schemes lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those produced on healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , representing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.3 @-@ times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after two times daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ oma has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests that included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither gu@@ ague nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of ag@@ ro@@ gen@@ ase after the end of treatment .
studies of toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which lay significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us jug@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gen@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous dosing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance is recommended , since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ath .
if clinical reasons are required to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , Israel@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this medicine .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test persons , the fluor@@ os@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous injection of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ast@@ er@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous dosing of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ th@@ in@@ dr@@ ate ) led to a reduction of AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the down@@ time .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro for HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State via the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and represent a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given simultaneously with as@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies of toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles that were treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabol@@ ites are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase Solution is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; baked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase solution to intake was demonstrated neither in patients treated with PI nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ a Cap@@ sul@@ es and Solution are not inter@@ changeable on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination will be avoided in these patient populations .
although a dose adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase Solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gen@@ ase is a solution for taking small children and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent doses may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabol@@ isation of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of developing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be terminated in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction of AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sul@@ es ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous exposure to as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral injection of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the pro@@ pane containing the pro@@ pane ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves into breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in the 55 body weight .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ mand@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be carried up three times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream should be applied to the affected areas of the skin , so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo given up either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible asc@@ ents in the genital or perio@@ don@@ tal area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment regi@@ men described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should begin ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should take care of the cream once he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , ti@@ lt @-@ infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with a stri@@ k@@ tur leading to circumc@@ ision .
using i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment , has also been observed in rare cases .
in cases where such responses occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment for the affected area .
no clinical experience has yet been submitted to the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream directly following treatment with other sta@@ ins applied to the treatment of extreme inclin@@ ations in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal region .
limited data points to an increased rate of reduction reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group regarding the elimination of the gra@@ dients .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair removal was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in the case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is available , so the application in pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ede@@ ma therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not investigated for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
only very limited data is available about the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , so such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions cause the patient to cause great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesi@@ ons had a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development are emerging from animal studies ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were reached after one @-@ time topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequently shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local responses to the site of the treatment of the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream associated with side effects include discomfort on the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side @-@ side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effect in these studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects listed by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
this clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ ori@@ zation / descent / sli@@ pp@@ age ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) occurred in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this review , according to the study plan , showed that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ ink@@ age and swelling ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or surrounding area .
the acci@@ dentally unique intake of 200 m@@ g. of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentration of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was demonstrated that the efficacy in reference to a complete healing of the pitch war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is significantly superior .
at 60 % of the 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients treated patients completely ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % from 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared with 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically verified individual primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that around 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a cohesi@@ ve 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face .
the annual data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external gra@@ dients , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ fici@@ ality bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and have therefore not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ede@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of medicine in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 , and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application to MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ nat@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ lim@@ eter weight ; a study for the der@@ mal application , which was carried out for four months , showed no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice at the age of three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumor tumours .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors performed in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by approximately 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normally large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion location .
very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic response ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the whole European Union .
lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any adverse event occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
as a result of the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that virtually all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , caution must be cau@@ tious due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
to treat 60 minutes before in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ ro@@ co@@ ca@@ ine ) in order to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a minor or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed by reducing the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not allow for direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .
side effects in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 trial ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma observed during the phase 3 trial and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with a predominantly severe form of delay and a duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a ser@@ ologic version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with the patient at the age of 5 with a more severe form of delay ( mean after 26 days compared to 45 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) in 13 / 45 patients no antibodies were detected ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody levels a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in urine .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 trial and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in a recovery of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity sufficient for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken from cells to lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the whole spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3,5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation of patients taking into consideration clin@@ ically significant changes across five effects ( normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted where the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients , who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients , an increase in size ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development rate of younger patients ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form , whereas in older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available , evaluate each year , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ off gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to man .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of pier@@ cing bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood count changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed thus s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months when c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin was administered .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ni were longer survival times compared to the comparison medication .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with a 4.@@ 7.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the required volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in the predomin@@ ating plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with cross @-@ cell lung or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except in the predomin@@ ating plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of the therapy and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created before each application - including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose reductions a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 or older , there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 or older .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies there was no need for c@@ anned adap@@ tations in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase levels of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone markers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ er number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for additional cycles is based on the absolute neutral number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ h@@ is@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all treated patients must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( C@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergometer prior to the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment is to be considered .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , when this compound was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be cau@@ tioned against the treatment of G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding semen conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti@@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed elimination with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in high doses of patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided at high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b are available , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no dates for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as with ing@@ ame an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is given by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ ency data : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was established regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .

for this table a threshold of 5 % was specified regarding the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received a random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 of three distinct P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Mono@@ therapy studies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be attributed to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could be associated with the study of study ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSCLC , random@@ ly receiving C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , and 8@@ 30 patients with NSCLC , random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients receiving random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed included :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received treatment received C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed consisted of :
severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinics with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
from clinical studies , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal ble@@ ed@@ ings , sometimes fatal , intestinal infection , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis associated with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ torture , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important , acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mic lat@@ ency ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind phase 3 trial of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma demonstrated that A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated survival compared to those patients who were only d@@ elt with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the test medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) versus the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy took medi@@ an survival of patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( intent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival of patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separate random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , which accounts for about a quarter of fats fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily sta@@ ins at anus , fl@@ ate ( win@@ ch ) with stools , bow@@ el , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , duct o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are taken out of the digestive tract ) or in chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or with breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) weight loss and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ vent ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dose of anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic may be adjusted if necessary .
patients who are using all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take extra pregnancy precau@@ tions to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions between drugs and in several cases , with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international standard @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the dosage of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal flora and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
the frequency of known side effects noted after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in most cases reported after the market introduction of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the existing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect takes place in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ i and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was used three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fet@@ al nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,@@ 8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline = 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of stimulation .
two major metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated treatment , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular threat to humans .
the owner of the approval for the transport must ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your eating habits .
in order to reach your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Do not eat fat to reduce the likel@@ ihood of food @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical exercise . • Sta@@ y during intake and even after ending the intake of all@@ i physically active .
• all@@ i may not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you cannot determine any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
under certain circumstances , you must finish the intake of all@@ i . • With a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet only at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour passed since the last meal , take the capsule to . • If more than one hour since the last meal has passed , do not take any capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily discharge , sudden or increased chair sle@@ d@@ ging and soft chair ) are due to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ats , skin r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory disorder .
29 Very frequent side effects These can occur with more than 1 out of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • Blue stool with and without o@@ ily discharge • Pl@@ ötz@@ lich chair • gre@@ asy or o@@ ily chair • Soft Chair Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects ampli@@ fies or significantly impaired you .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use @-@ information .
the most common side @-@ effects are related to the effects of the capsules and cause more fat to be ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , because at this time you may have not consistently reduced fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in some days , or better a week prior to the first intake of capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich Main Court or a substantial Nach@@ tisch@@ sch@@ ism as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis - talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases from det@@ ecting and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which quantity is suitable for you , take a look at the information below , which indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by observing the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of food @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to gradually lose weight .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal each day , for example through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a long @-@ term weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep them in compliance . • At@@ temp@@ t is a nutrition diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program for supporting weight loss combines capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you eat cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate stimul@@ i for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is insufficient information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) versus 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ated chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the thi@@ ckets , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is advised with concur@@ rent gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to extend such extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is said to be used in the days after chemotherapy neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five investig@@ ational chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous addition of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ zin , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies the most common side effects were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could be associated with Alo@@ ysi@@ a , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the birth place ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were indicated in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ x@@ ia over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron that were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ated chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c Inter@@ val with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption After intraven@@ ous injection follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations as a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the overall dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured at 42 ± 34 % was measured at 11 testi@@ cular car@@ cin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher after the one @-@ off dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism , we showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection of inj@@ ections , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , terminal elimination may be reduced and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ions in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the potential for action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al nerves ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is used in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .
the owner of this permit for placing the order must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the medicine approved in the context of this decision .

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by the Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmac@@ eu@@ tically effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue exhibits damage , and the values of the Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) enzyme are further increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( agent structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug in 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been vo@@ iced that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was more likely to burn more patients than with the reference drug . moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection accompanied by crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go might not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients with placebo and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients with placebo discussed the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at home users , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common adverse event with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the Princip@@ al .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve Al@@ tar@@ go on the whole of the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection can be started .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected spot occurs after 2 to 3 days treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been obtained in humans after topical use on sk@@ ul@@ fed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ X increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on weakened skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibited .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity according to oral dosage and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fo@@ etus / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , is to weigh between the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that used Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the date of administration which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance produced by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the B@@ ind@@ ungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin at least some infection forms might appear question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin by S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the event of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
sample sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake at humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabol@@ ism@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel @-@ test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ared skin ) :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vaccine plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix is only allowed to be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immun@@ ization and that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is required against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ines Twin@@ rix approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 , Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix &apos;s and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix &apos;s adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the portion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix performed in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ eness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for the immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two vaccine doses , the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if the vacc@@ ination is required for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibodies were immun@@ ized with the combination vaccine in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mono@@ cul@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all inj@@ ections , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine should always be immediately available for medical treatment and monitoring .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 enz@@ ym@@ atic units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the immun@@ ization , so that in these cases the administration of additional vacc@@ ines can be necessary .
as an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination , these injection routes should be avoided .
however , with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected in an exceptional way , as in these cases it can lead to bleeding after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ ps @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see paragraph 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ eness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ ase and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 V@@ acc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years the intoler@@ ance of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ iness on a calculation basis per vaccine Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.8 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix were over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dos@@ e- combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ch@@ iness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vaccine in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ iness was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ent group was comparable to that observed when administration with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported on severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ t@@ ins vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 up to and including 15 years , serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ation@@ vaccine with three cans .
in the 28@@ 9 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 dose vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for persons who were aged between 12 and 15 years of immun@@ ization , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response against both anti@@ gens , observed in this study , was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after immun@@ ization in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 month vaccine scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with the re@@ combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ h @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ro@@ cker @-@ vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar serum and serum rates similar to the previous formulation for the current formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through food @-@ containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease from being vacc@@ inated .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If a allergic reaction has occurred to you / your child for an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled dosing of the second vaccine ) .
at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination against end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she is in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be ino@@ cul@@ ated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
it is usually not given to Ambi@@ ani pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgent that they are ino@@ cul@@ ated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix : please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 de@@ but@@ ted cans ) : • pain or discomfort in the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 de@@ but@@ ted cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recycled drinking cans ) are reported :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the initial approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with a complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is divided into several individual doses of meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered through a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active substance ) .
ammon@@ ia can also result in loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste problems , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ammon@@ ia effectively prevented the absorption of high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ia was approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information on this drug occurred due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ ated form ( incomplete en@@ cy@@ stic defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients suffering from swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ modi@@ fi@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kidneys is carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ ing of the ne@@ ural increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it was not possible to determine whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ ac@@ ia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ ank@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental over@@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting ne@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic @-@ active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of perceived sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ ally ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ial en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time for many to mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its .
patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ modi@@ fi@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who were recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ial en@@ cephal@@ opathy , and were then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated to glut@@ amine in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by injection of a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were observed 15 minutes after taking .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a drugs or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma the next morning after ni@@ ghtly fast .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma bar were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is secre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate did not have any sp@@ her@@ ical effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not yet swallow tablets or have a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe ) .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ modi@@ fi@@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required at a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) before birth , lesi@@ ons occurred in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tat@@ ac@@ ia , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ ank@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat .
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate taken for each gram can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible even in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ules form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were observed 15 minutes after intake .
during durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring sco@@ op 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine through a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if you undergo laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , hind@@ ran@@ ces of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neurological conditions have also been observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , contact your doctor or emergency room at your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS out on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c tube ( which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose leading through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ ap@@ ed spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Fil@@ l a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended amount of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container .
Angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stem lever &quot; ( an abnormal measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , Angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , Angi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ valent u@@ dine , other her@@ u@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it should not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transfer of angi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency response or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a further consequence of a PCI is carried out in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
directly before the procedure , an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an immediate IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a certain Bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before application and the dosage dose is given intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al dys@@ functional restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the administration of the bi@@ val@@ ü@@ din Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against cereb@@ ral pal@@ sy • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased bleeding disorders due to a mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ og@@ as@@ esis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ valent u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most ble@@ ed@@ ings of arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , patients who undergo a Per@@ cut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform ble@@ ed@@ ings during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ valent u@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ dine again reaches the level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ator ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ valent u@@ dine with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are checked regularly in each case .
in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development , animal experiments are insufficient ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ valent u@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ valent u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
in the Bi@@ val@@ ü@@ dine group as well as in the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ a / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or and bi@@ d@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point of position , reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in cone of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in cone of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ valent u@@ dine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI study .
in the Bi@@ val@@ ü@@ dine group as well as in the groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped according to system classes listed in table 6 .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine can be canc@@ eled immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ id@@ ine , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as the ani@@ onic bond region of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in , irrespective of whether it is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ valent u@@ dine to thro@@ m@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is rever@@ sible because , in turn , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the bond of Bi@@ val@@ id@@ u@@ dine @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
moreover , bi@@ valent @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ valent u@@ dine shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ valent ir@@ u@@ dine was given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients undergoing treatment within 72 hours of a angi@@ ography .
the primary analysis and results from the A@@ cu@@ ity study for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes who need a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study with 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied for type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot operate effectively .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin doses .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human slim insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin sensitivity or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the stomach .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function .
any change of effective strength , brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can involve a change in the need for insulin .
3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin requiring insulin , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching between a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage required .
the date of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the treatment of the treatment scheme .
the substances which increase blood glucose levels and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disp@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ ers such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ano thi@@ dine and Reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation may be weakened or absent .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
following are listed in clinical trials of adverse drug effects , grouped by system classes and classified according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) .
cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual fatigue or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive hun@@ - ger , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is failed to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , as a result , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated with an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ t agon@@ in@@ jek@@ tion , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effectiveness occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ a normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ity @-@ lowering effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range , and at 0.3 mg / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ ity @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and generates the full glucose @-@ lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was apparent that a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , as with the human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
when insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was used 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with normal insulin @-@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as the normal insulin @-@ insulin , which is given in front of the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to the normal insulin analog that was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in by offering 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to humane anti@@ ques , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
