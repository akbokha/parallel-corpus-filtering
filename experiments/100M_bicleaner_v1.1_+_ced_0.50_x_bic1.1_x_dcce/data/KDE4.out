&quot; &quot; &quot; the module &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate website &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu on Tools web page . select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire URL .
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , translations do not make any important decisions , without checking the translation before .
only websites on the internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can insert texts to be translated directly .
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , by making them more readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Guide to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions ... Open the card menu Tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of default settings modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or has crashed , or the list of crashes , if present .
the module ru@@ dder filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M Tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ items , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbolic and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in showing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be detected , even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap account representing a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either show depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and thus , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
at Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always kept . it is drawn to show the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this frame will need space that will not be available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square .
how to divide the space of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses by setting the area in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can specify the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry View Vie@@ ws on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the module gallery , a dialog opens with which you can specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field .
the option Images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
the file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to view the file size of the image , see if the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumb@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the image size check box , you can determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery in the gallery .
in the dialog box , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .

with the check box sub@@ folder , you can adjust with a slider or a rotating field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
if you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery , you can copy the original pictures into the gallery .
you can use the ann@@ ot@@ ation box ann@@ ot@@ ation file to specify a comment text for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box &apos;s own color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ cam ; -@@ Albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will be with &amp; digi@@ cam ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ code ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG @-@ export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with considerably more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ cam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements .
where ever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report .... This will open a dialog with a signed link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is listed here . just follow the instructions to submit your report .
&amp; digi@@ code ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; then we &apos;d like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for submission in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you first start , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter your path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ code ; will also be used as an alpha library . settings digi@@ tis@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as a basic folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; view any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . while browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ cam ; searches recur@@ sively for the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this allows you to insert extra @-@ bs &amp; digi@@ cam ; do it by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as icons . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My sampling box to manage your photos in the albums .
the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ cam ; -@@ Albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will be with &amp; digi@@ cam ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . the camera then appears as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection has become obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ k@@ am can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I module : the K@@ DE Image Plugins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to developing a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ cam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ cam ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ cam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ um@@ er@@ tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type sel@@ ector allows you to emphasize the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter will only work on the file name only if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ cam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ thic properties or after the date the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ported sc@@ anners . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select to edit album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort out your photos , if you want to add or delete collections from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date .
the Buttons elders , average , New Year : these put the date on that of the oldest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ pt , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; it will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select in context menu &amp; quot ; As a album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the My keywords list on the left side of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the frame window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nail images are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools All preview images in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can choose to edit settings ; set up the albums page and customize the thumb@@ nail area to suit your preferences .
the screen@@ shot shows the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ cam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing pictures .
you can open image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select . in the section edited ; image editing you can see instructions on how to edit your photos . image editing lets you view and change your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File menu .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . this is why this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ cam ; delete it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin from &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My date list ; organizes your photos by using the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the data view so that only the photos of the days chosen will be shown .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords in the loss of the database are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ cam ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My sampling rate ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select new keyword . if you click on an existing keyword after you click on an existing keyword , it becomes the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting the keyword in the keyword menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My stu@@ ds .
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stu@@ ds . alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right click the context menu of the photo and select from the keyword menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ ately adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit . this will display all the corresponding pictures in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small lamp that turns green when the search matches hits . when you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is shown in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you have entered as search criteria . after you have been saved , it appears in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in My Search List in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form to enter the search again appears with the search information entered previously . if you select Add as advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you can find more information in the section The tool for Advanced search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu search .
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ code ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ b database . all rules will be added to / searched by operators . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group del@@ eting or del@@ eting them . additionally , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it down there .
sketch : hand @-@ hand sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the matching images . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o Filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ ator add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ code ; main window are , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place it . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then these are also executed in the other picture .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of images . if you are using pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the same . now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it on the left side . this simpli@@ fies it to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal extingu@@ ishing operations also work directly from the lamp table such as F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting ....
all picture information from the main window of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nail images in the light table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to turn the visible area of the picture , you have to click these and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both pictures will show the same image area .
zoom is the same as in other views . simply use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of us records , scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , find , protect and use photographs again . we will focus on the procedures for digital photographer the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tures and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data via data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a certain photo no longer without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach can store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving , which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you sort out anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you want to print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the settings page of the Met@@ adata Editor . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? for this , &amp; digi@@ cam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign each picture keywords , labels and a rating . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then the tree will be set up for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one sub@@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different metadata can over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to see your photos , they want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you are sure about how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer , to help Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is al@@ right if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can store as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as label . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time .
do you remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ok@@ ement are countless and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic indications .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information was written in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support either comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed as well .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the bi@@ dder field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a camp photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change these , embedded in the image . for private individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will in the near future provide such a module for batch processing .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we have problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to be treated careful and you may not be trusted longer than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and sound recor@@ ders and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you are just written . this is why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for corrupt CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy it to a clean , dark dry and wildlife @-@ protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
disc@@ ot@@ ors keep their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives : disc@@ la@@ imer study
bre@@ aches are the most frequent error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT termin@@ ate the imminent failure . these are especially reading errors and en@@ camp@@ ments . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t make a lot of power coll@@ isions , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processor . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause blocked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and ear@@ ns the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every connector also includes over@@ voltage protection .
if you look for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning strikes and thus protect the properly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actor that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ ax cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection against surge vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and run down the system . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end , remember to always remember all cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
they are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data over the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are based on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies , the offer includes a backup and a distributed storage .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under one license .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % in work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that as technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more impaired . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data often after a plan and test this backup before you have anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash is struck , you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget an air@@ space : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbour house , into your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete assurance and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . produces multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
back up important images just after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this method allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC information stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ invent images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ wards a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the fewer varieties you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should already be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alisation is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ I ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of row if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software available , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should no longer use it .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GI@@ F . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages pictures in high quality , but requires very large files .
D@@ NG . the digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open source image format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block@@ ade ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ gt ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , most of the time in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . but it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and place it all together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the map reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera beam , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . they may be cut off by the other programs .
protect the copy@@ rights with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web galleries , encoding in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ b database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use it , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . with some cameras this can take a while . if the connection is established , a Fer@@ tig indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras not all information is available .
the metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notices , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the editing pane &apos;s metadata page bar ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we suggest you check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download selected . the selected button is gra@@ yed out until you selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ code ; downloaded . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
if you download the All or Sel@@ ected Files button , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be displayed in the section My Albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only a few , you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera , so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully taken into a &amp; digi@@ cam ; you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera name , as this is much faster .
the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to integrate into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer , three other options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC squares . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , turn on the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case when downloading . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . its settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ code ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and when your camera does not provide this information , it lets &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case saving &amp; digi@@ code ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use this option . use the Advanced button and select Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
when the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser with a click that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ ones and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a couple working with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script using the Ex@@ it Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als to create ha@@ sty coordinates , for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ code ; tries to give you so much control over its working procedures as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; change . in order to access these settings , you must be edited in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing are set . thus , you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; note when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should include the professional description of the photographer . this can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a closer description of the author field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as these the picture is a camp photo , then the group or agency should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the &amp; digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be exported in &amp; digi@@ code ; imported without being lost .
image cap@@ tions as embedded in@@ scriptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the let@@ tering embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category .
each time you open the table , these settings are not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can only get better view results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it &apos;s meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since P@@ NG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value on high compression .
with the TI@@ FF @-@ files option , you can switch the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ loss setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ code , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it is very quickly developing into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a little bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect of under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images are burned down , because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as a penet@@ rating white . the setting colors trigger some unusual results because it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ cam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when selecting the re@@ stru@@ tion option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture .
put the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing . in order to minimize the time for the demo @-@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w present three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as it is carried out during the blan@@ king conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ cam ; for information such as colour information from a color space to translate into the other , the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Fol@@ low the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ire ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on Canon &apos;s models . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ code ; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controls adjust the time between the transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into / off , which appears at the lower end of the images during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all supported cameras on the left side . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture @-@ line mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on .
check whether &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side of the page can be tac@@ itly deleted by &amp; digi@@ code ; applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any questions . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also display the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welcome screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen , stopping at startup . this speeds up the opening process from &amp; digi@@ cam ; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the setting When start looking for new photos is forced &amp; digi@@ cam ; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time from &amp; digi@@ cam ; . when something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ code ; used to match the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ code ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section image editing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , which displays file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo , before you have used File Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or the button The button Rest@@ ore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last backup .
almost any action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored , and the last action can be und@@ one by modi@@ fying or re@@ stores editing by selecting re@@ producing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to remember .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo / restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
to adapt a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you get to the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can also change it in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can call it from the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window . see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print wizard from the menu Ex@@ ports . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation files , also available in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the user button , or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the assessment is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a box with the keywords used in this &amp; digi@@ code ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a series of images . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keyword ( s ) can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Key@@ word Tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section .
the Key@@ word filters page is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keywords and search views . if additionally one or more key@@ word@@ filters from the right side are used , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the top example the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings O@@ ther@@ Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it would have to be one or it , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry according to which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already placed in the database .
for example , you can specify an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ cam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that reflect the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the subject comes to color management , then everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflow . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other images are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the two @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor because s@@ RGB believes that your monitor is on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the s@@ RGB colour space , then you need to connect your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , offset , automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try to make the most of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ance values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the bri@@ ghtest dot is as bright as possible without changing its shade .
similarly , nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels . sometimes the balance has very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ tone and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hi@@ sto@@ grams area .
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new arrangement of all values in between . this is only visible with well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because working with an 8 @-@ bit colour space . so if you are too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right up , a hist@@ ogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or decrease the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance . this way , also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the stores save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the Col@@ ors Sound Editor menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to store multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar rotation effect , a su@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash beam and afterwards the development of the image was completed . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light .
the intensity controls the solar plex@@ us . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase in the picture eventually creates a negative image that is not to be generated on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it bri@@ gh@@ tens many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a light @-@ optimized film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrasting edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color spots of your photo with the tools in the menu under Color . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too great satur@@ ation . in this case too , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
the tool ton@@ value correction is located between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you only need the section of the slider for the application cited here . concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph , three slides are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the knob and watch how the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear representation is often the most useful . in images the large areas of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the upper@@ most one for the dark tones , the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the mid frequencies , commonly called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with input values . for example , the compression of output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : these buttons can store the set values in the fil@@ esystem and load them later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shades , medium and bright colors . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve section to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker .
preview the original photo is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : these buttons allow you to do exactly this . each curve that you have created can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
select the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and Sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam &apos;s channel mixer ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shade of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel Mixer of image processing .
using the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color . colored is made up of small noise files that don &apos;t appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed picture under ( 2 ) to see .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filtered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange l@@ enti@@ cular filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filtered .
Rot@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . similarly , like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ achi@@ an : produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ ph@@ us . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the image .
a paper textile effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . add under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , adjust the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ing effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the frame decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text in a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . the larger the image , the larger the character set must be .
any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool template you can put a template on a picture .
the Image template can be used in image processing can be used to place sten@@ cils via a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template , just send an email to the &amp; digi@@ cam ; mailing list digi@@ cam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button Base Fol@@ der in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be marked for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the thumb@@ nail of the template automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture . the picture will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each one of them has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images .
blur@@ red mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture blur@@ red . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ educational . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digi@@ tization process of colours with minimal differences to one color . elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined to form a common color . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the home user .
in JPEG images a camera is often applied in internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , pictures in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable them , you will get the control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness tool . this can be called with the menu entry Cor@@ rection Fol@@ low .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus . you can re@@ focus on the menu entry correc@@ ting . under re@@ focus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the soft sign tool with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried at first . an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask to strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum of the RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . this allows for a minimum difference to be applied to a duct of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from sharp@@ ness and therefore fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted de@@ fl@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus mostly achieves better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , circular folding works much better than the pal@@ atal cle@@ av@@ age . the pal@@ atal cle@@ av@@ age has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also depending on the source pixel , which is far from the original tor@@ ment pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your blur@@ red Gau@@ ß is . this is most commonly caused by a previously performed Un@@ ke@@ fe Filter . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . however , please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the save as and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all cutting , color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before otherwise alter@@ ing the picture . the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress pictures , and eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , vag@@ ab@@ ely mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring of a larger neighbourhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter . practically , the result of the F@@ IR Vienn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red color image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the follow @-@ up methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the knob regul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ corporation algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings to use .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ th@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details so that no sharpen@@ ing is required afterwards . please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordin@@ ate to the direction depen@@ dency .
alignment Ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film or CCD noise will generate a high value wa@@ vy pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . usually 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle measurement range &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . be aware that small angles create a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never exceed 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only minimal . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the stores save as and load exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be corrected in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Canc@@ el .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts removed . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove sta@@ ins and other arti@@ facts from e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read it in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel is required and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more distorted , but also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of phase j@@ itter damp@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius is re@@ acted to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is labeled ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was used with default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ ten@@ er with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ eren sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Arti@@ facts Re@@ duce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the stores save as and load exactly this . each setting of photo restor@@ ations can be stored in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel enables the Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression are equipped with built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically rel@@ o@@ ad it to the next session .
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
dur@@ ess : an average of neigh@@ b@@ oured pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is visible below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
using digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying a equi@@ val@@ ent transformation to a picture that was made without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting gra@@ ding applies the transformation with a c@@ rank filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ ting filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0@@ mm , which causes an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly of a light intensity of 2 , lower it to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma setting : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical l@@ enti@@ ls on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar circular effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ ding correc@@ ts the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second graph . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion can be corrected .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth graph . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameters &apos; has the revers@@ ed mark of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . ideally , perform this correction first . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent to the groove .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal line of help . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you rec@@ tify a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu from image editing or via the Zoom controller of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera manually , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) can be seen .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infr@@ a @-@ red film by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob influences the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter bl@@ ends color channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel it doesn &apos;t make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . in order to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the picture gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more kern@@ els , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film sample effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sketch . the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect .
there are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper slider sel@@ ects the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adapting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving influences your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave Block 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave Block 2 : analog@@ ously to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the sound effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines starting from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by rotating the pixels to a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ r : blur@@ bs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ bs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ ter sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent weed : finds the far@@ my@@ ard in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops in the picture .
you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ieren Tur@@ ning / Transform@@ ieren Spi@@ egels .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to get the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ s in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
retained aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Lo@@ ad buttons are used exactly for this purpose . every single image for photo magni@@ fication can be stored as a text file and then loaded again later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small paint image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear enlarged enlargement .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool in order to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and moving the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the blank , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the File Save or File menu entry in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the rect@@ angle size by moving the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or a landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
the tool Fol@@ ding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio , it saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed picture dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the combination help make it possible to hide help , so that you can better compose your images . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmonious parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to share a rect@@ angle squar@@ ed in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden mean : the golden mean is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us m@@ uss@@ el or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this type .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , gold tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal on these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ontal Editor &apos;s Horiz@@ ontal Panels are used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Autom@@ atically cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option makes the image smoo@@ thing a little bit after the turn . but be aware of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is blur@@ red a little . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
the firing tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal shift , for example , will shift the top part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
for your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture will get a little blur@@ red . for a single lubrication , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two insul@@ ators produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the drawing , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ code ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; digi@@ code ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ code ; you can change this list of the File Exten@@ sions .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ code ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss @-@ free if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format images into JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw format converter from &amp; digi@@ code ; in the Con@@ figuration section you can find further information on using &amp; digi@@ cam modules .
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ code ; it supports more than 200 shell file formats . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of shell formats that are supported by &amp; digi@@ cam ;
many digital cameras support the shooting of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; does not understand video editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playing .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need the photo editing are available in &amp; digi@@ code ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise reduction , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring , etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper part shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are derived from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out zo@@ oming with the mouse wheel . move it while you click the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot user defined color and last unused colors .
in the dialog Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described under the P@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box by@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ write selected . this mode can be set by selecting the crossing field over@@ write under Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and In@@ sert .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color follows . if there are three figures in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ector can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graph@@ ene is used in science , especially in computer science . up to now there was no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are out@@ dated according to the program author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ gra@@ ph . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ;

other required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph pres@@ upp@@ oses . needs are :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ bar@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
once you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner , if the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited by factor 10 in both directions . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graph viewer ; set up ... see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ yp@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it afterwards with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split up to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page should be adapted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled with the relevant parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages without head@@ line and another font
the Renew@@ able load page gives the option to set the behavior when a file is changed to disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the Open page gives the option to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ person@@ viewers ; specify if a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the session administration page gives you the option to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ person@@ viewers ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) the files of the last session or specify to be asked for each startup .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; opens up further options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ numerical graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the jump @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .

the K@@ IP@@ I module contains images to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan Images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
if you can scan the images from the menu entry , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by clicking the default duc@@ er &apos;s default values to select your image . watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
after you press the scan button , wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Im@@ por@@ tier@@ - &gt; screen shot ... a window will appear in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop read only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options dialog appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management online . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world showing your camera images online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
when you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication , so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successfully logging in , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you press Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support other authori@@ z@@ ations . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly options , you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera function must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera function . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ ing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button Cor@@ relation to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog reveals the coordinates of one call to the next , you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set by the displayed map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Do this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy . the altitude must be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages con@@ form to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums which should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization possible .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right @-@ hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be created in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the Album tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thumb@@ nail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery . press close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found in the P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera button is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed among image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the gra@@ ding of the images respectively the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds to show a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the production of the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your machine , you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slide show if you are back again .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages through the button settings right down .
the Print As@@ sist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats , JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file which should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option will determine whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for that .
tagged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use them later , you should not choose the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion by exec@@ uting button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ ride existing files . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can shrink the image or enlarge . there are four types of image changes made available :
proportional ( 1 dot ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 di@@ am . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
press Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo api@@ ece . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . additional images can be drawn to the list of images to be sent and put off there .
after you have started the module , the images window will be shown with the pictures selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview of the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop them to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button remove pictures , the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images selected by you are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it might be a good idea to send emails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . their configuration is stored and each time used until you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after choosing comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend JPEG format .
if you select JPEG among images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ fers are added to the images to be sent .
when the process is ready , the window is not automatically closed so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program is automatically started at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; module , a window appears with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the albums you selected and all the images of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name Display &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . afterwards , you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option pictures random make sure the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the pictures in the album .
between the pictures , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date still has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
as soon as you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these images , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are entries in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you typ@@ ed information when you have submitted your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to display images next to the names , select the button that is located on the right @-@ hand side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must determine yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you must select the picture @-@ view window ( in closer description ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . in the view window , you can select the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you run the search in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the setting of the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the image .
if you want to enter a string in the Lab@@ eling or Description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text . if you wish , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be a part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will see pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introductory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try them .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this paste shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed pre@@ views from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will only preview images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .

before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three fields of content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select if you want to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file that is visible on the overview page . you can find information about the export files in .
finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed on the viewer without description . for example , that all pictures are of a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically made .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this way , those who look at your website and own a monitor who supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 have no more images download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so , it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a smaller transfer time . if it wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best of all , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is stored and next time automatically added . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE @-@ supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created will start . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , properly you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings currently described have all been related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of all images to be saved in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ...
the most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the manual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Manual near the .@@ k@@ im file &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the option Autom@@ atically copy &amp; photo@@ album copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit picture size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the im@@ porting wizard is made up of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category of persons belonging to the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently it closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the upper@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the folder where your images are stored and automatically use them for future launches . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you will be able to change to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will see the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key and click on the option you want by pressing a button .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of one group at one time in one group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can invo@@ ke via the module itself .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I hadn &apos;t warned you !
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are simply a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the pictures that show you the preview at the moment .
besides the current album you have to pass a list of albums , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do so , so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen once you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu bar and tool@@ bar at the top . there is not much information under the tool@@ bar , as you have not added any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people depicted on the picture , where the picture has been taken , etc . , for example , you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box , in which you can set people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on sliding the images within the list : for example , if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved upwards , to find and assign people more quickly .
if you &apos;d rather want to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting button by date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , just click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have taken several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an overview . to show you that this is an over @-@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the l@@ ath which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to see this window later again , use the button Options ... and then a / out window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the image in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set a filter . for example , you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t open a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the images you want to delete and select either the Del@@ ete button or select Edit Select from the Edit menu . now the window will be shown to you in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; that is to use pictures without you saved on your hard drive . of course you have to store the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nail images are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view these images too . you can also not view these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support it until now to ask for the inser@@ tion of the concerned CD . so if you want to avoid irritation like the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it .
in the pictures menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make accessible to others and click on Rec@@ ent View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can view , control and unlock the menu item Any other than current view .
so you have set what pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , which makes all the images you have locked away . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text .
the reason you all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the top of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here on the browser , see the matching entries for this view . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide shows . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer is using the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can pull in the image and zoom out . you can use the Min@@ us button to zoom into the center of the picture with the Min@@ us button . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the results of the zo@@ oms .
with the key button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel on the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out with the plus and minus keys are .
with the rotation functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer allows you to provide images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all of them to your comments . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features may be displayed in the preview view . if you want to display categories in dre Pre@@ view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray , you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully mastered , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you necessarily read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mode views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , because all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can rec@@ tify the input errors and then click on the user or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
when you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation already .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility Level of the higher object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility Level of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window assignments and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below an existing view , drag the anus to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the viewer in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card holders at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the anus on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left above in the cham@@ fer strip .
to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
you can save the current window view with View window setup ... save . it will display a dialog in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , it was &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon to render the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar , or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images in the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that shows the characteristics of the mode .
in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image cut to render into the input fields .
in the quality combination field , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray are used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use retro @-@ reflective lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you switch off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling involves the adjacent pixels .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam of pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are pursued individually and are checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for the display of the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the Import sub@@ menu file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; not yet the full range of commands from &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Sup@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , just tick the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with Copy and In@@ sert in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
when you click Help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example high field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene directory , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object by@@ catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wi@@ re@@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the bottom , a floor below the objects is rendered . the bottom is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page , you can change existing window assignments or create new window assignments . in the section window settings , it explains how to create and store window assignments .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : shows all available window assignments . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window assignment at the start of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add window &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; list shows all available window assignments . a new arrangement can be added with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ove &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be added with the Add button and Del@@ ete selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
with a new column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating firmly entr@@ en@@ ched the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; installed and now you want to start without a thorough knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything without error , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in view has control points that you can change the focus of the camera . just click on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you click the user or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a loader ( insert End@@ able Body Qu@@ ad ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the plane , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : scale , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ment shows only a matt black material , because you have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on a header and a bul@@ let in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then go to the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose single @-@ color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step , as you should have understood the basic method of working with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Models ; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has moved over the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface looks like a matt black material . in the following step , place a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . like on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
select First sub @-@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the input button .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces even if metal is not selected at all :
you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er offers ; hopefully you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a source of light you see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last un@@ done command . you can only select this menu item if you have used the Edit menu .
saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can modify or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands modify or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simul@@ ate rough surfaces without having to chis@@ el each be@@ eh@@ le on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can use by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ N ; or the En@@ ter key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Di@@ alogue inser@@ tion - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this item is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; in@@ feed show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ok@@ show ; set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option the display window will be enlarged for large images on the full screen . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of work &amp; ku@@ ok@@ ie show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this display can only be displayed in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display can only be displayed in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ cam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user &apos;s part contributing to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialogue with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . if you use this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all information needed is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , we would like to encourage you to answer the user mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to join , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its working procedures as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you need to set a show@@ foto in the menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicator , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you are supposed to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ foto ; has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sc@@ rum@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer works as images to scan and save images .
&amp; sc@@ rum@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer works as images to scan and save images . &amp; sc@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; for each image , open a dialog to save or store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; on the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog will open to choose the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sc@@ ou@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sc@@ ou@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ k@@ ane ) does not particularly treat these options .
in order to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan scan and then scan scan area for the final scan . the preview scan is started by the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . he can adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview in the settings is selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as seen below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and drag ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button opens the dialogue of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the kind of &amp; sc@@ rap@@ l@@ ite ; open images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sc@@ ou@@ l@@ ite ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a file name .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is added up each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button Via starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; gu@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sc@@ rum@@ l@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global key short@@ cut allows you to set up by right mouse button in the player window and select Global short@@ cuts .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this allows you to make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use a k@@ dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run .
require &apos; cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos;
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should include any K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the default scripts . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now be called &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions additional information about the new piece ( such as the metadata or the piece length ) can be retri@@ eved .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume indicates a change of volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove one entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can optionally also be loaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can download it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for just a certain title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
you might already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which ones you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music .
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so they can be used . for details see the System Requi@@ rements section .
enables de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple flash@@ cards to set the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled , the option switches to the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric Design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled , the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer is modified .
add voice files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok is compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be launched when a browser is needed .
other browsers include : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not listed in the list .
playlist at exit save the current playlist automatically when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist at the end .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window will open up / roll to keep the piece running always in the visible window area .
when changing a piece of text to the context browser , the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next item is sp@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ap@@ pear@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; section you can adjust and Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gray described section . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist tab@@ s , player windows and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the selected color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog to select color sel@@ ections . if the colors are not selected , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music as well as their sub@@ folders .
monitoring Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box Driver : allows you to choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible .
use username : and password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card file last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts call : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can see the list in context Browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by looking at ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again be created .
most of the time it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email automatically opens on a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but don &apos;t label it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ ar@@ g@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / Dynamic play@@ lists ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok does the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
there are a few options . most of the installation problems are solved by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or to the developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ fix is not suitable to search for help . please insert only one error there if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok itself .
after launching &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right portion of the playlist .
to make the interface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating columns must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column Display . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the review for one piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click the right mouse button on your selection and then select from Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse to the playlist and drop it down there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar , just next to the addition button , you can save the playlist &apos;s playlist . click it .
you probably lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the e@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be noisy Wel@@ che media types supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat MP3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio . this can be achieved through a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. os@@ sin@@ ess ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ code . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
in K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed play . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts Dri@@ vers , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers react to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you must register all components . register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
then try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run it with the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size variable .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right click puts a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the control bar &apos;s system section ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .

the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
set the CD , then click Audio CD to play . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folders , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this suits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can add the review for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and pressing Edit : edit Evaluation or F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release schedule that is not connected to the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have caused a lot of crashes and a lot of error reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you have to re@@ configure and install it .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same is true for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output you enter the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :

enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , un@@ check the check box on sound@@ card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . of course , you are welcome to take this issue by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so urgently needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the wizard just don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will be set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
to create a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text field for filtering the collection makes it easy for you to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the button Play@@ list , and you will find this button in the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , these play@@ lists are already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , select A@@ ctions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . just drag the wa@@ v files into the playlist and then press the button Play@@ back .
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audio@@ CD : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the Bur@@ n feature is also available in the playlist . just right @-@ click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installing some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the range , the playing time , bit rate and sampling rate of the current piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the Player window . press d on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fied window .
under the running text display you can also find the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used for the E@@ quali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
using the built @-@ in e@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 preferences , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the e@@ quali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the e@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist for all players ; available multimedia player . it has many features that are not in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
context Browser shows different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later added to the detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window Start is away . the information shown there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . additionally , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here , how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment .
to display cover images in context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded either with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the album &apos;s content .
you can click on all pieces in each area to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites with the help of self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button searches for goo@@ gle@@ .com search for the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different performers .
group Interpre@@ t / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / performer - your pieces are sorted first by genre and below according to performer .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly beneath the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a selection box , which allows you to filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours to one year . furthermore , you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter virtually shut off .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and add the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attached to Play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
for media players transfer the pieces to the queu@@ es for the transfer to the media player . for more details , see the Media Player browser section .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - D@@ ue to this , the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and fired either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) move files into bin bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , mark the selected album as a compilation , promp@@ ting it to appear among different performers .
elev@@ ate compilation - change an album marked as compilation back into a normal album . after that the album is no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes dealing with many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( eg . iPod ) ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to interpreter in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . if the transmission is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release disk connectivity for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input button , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down the Shift key . in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : thereby dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . in order to reset the filter , press the button again until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter , for example , one or two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then close the search term with griff@@ in feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will look for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : - something is looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key pressed , and then click the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button , where you can add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . additionally , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ eving can be changed easily by double clicking the appropriate display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the general settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
clicking on this entry will open the window visualization plugin . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you will have more control over the playlist . once you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are already pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these play@@ lists later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or click the right mouse button on it and then select Lo@@ ad . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the play@@ lists Recommen@@ ded items begin with an empty playlist and you will have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the suggested items will be added to the next part , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , check the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button will emp@@ ower the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right @-@ click a dynamic playlist to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed , taking into account the settings played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will be added ; random bits from each of the play@@ lists you are crossing .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog , in which a script package can be selected for installation . once you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then uninstall it .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ nis@@ - und En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg , for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t W@@ MA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed cd &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize the different recording levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ si@@ ghtly effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog save is shown with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you were calling file save for every single project .
include the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you called for each project file close .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it is asked what to do with it , as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s Properties dialog . the only difference is the extra button Bur@@ n , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can set up a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them will be described using the What Is ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this also allows copying a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn later . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn later . additionally , the target medium has to be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) so the contents will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the used video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the medium used . this information is displayed in the contents view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
if the contents view is checked , its contents will be displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locks , and unlock the medium .
the contents view also allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected in the folder view with a corresponding CD / DVD .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views .
this will open a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is meant for person@@ alizing and for fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and type of task is vital , which of the included programs will give you the preference .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started ; then type something like the following :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name ) void Cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String Name , Q@@ String collision ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : List ur@@ ls , Q@@ String collision ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on enco@@ der installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many coding files that enco@@ des these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre@@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must be done now .
for the second step you have to have l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . all these programs are usually available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself .
which enco@@ der / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the CD ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device protection , it is not possible to circum@@ vent the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CDs ; s !
while the setup needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB enquiry of the CD data according to the arrangement of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; starts reading and - when a enco@@ der is configured in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Code of Con@@ figuration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , the encoding process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it should be noted that the enco@@ der in the encoding settings tab was configured in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the noti@@ fications ( such as Prot@@ o@@ cols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) .
opens the main Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different learning flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex tracks of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a song . good enough for music from youths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi@@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality , regardless of the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed and used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to coding explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; must be added . the result looks like : &apos; -@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters needed ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter audio CDs , so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : this means the author ) bin not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( fake ) address as the ones installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who reviewed the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b set up , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which tool is used to store pieces from the CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more closely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet .
for saving the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre@@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . this means that &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed enco@@ der .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on and ob both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understand everything , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine , as it is not considered completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write per@@ missions to it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with fre@@ ed@@ b to download the file ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them by reading one &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is forwarded to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM , and / or DVD drives .
here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only In case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet during the reading of the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD is found ; this is associated with low risk , if you are dis@@ satisfied later with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory / fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB large , think twice whether this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally with the server as many fire@@ walls boot the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , possibly more luck with the 80 protocol , because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : excuse , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just one available drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this for the CD ; to e@@ ject at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
just enter everything as shown on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , you may need to leaf a bit to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is around 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous to encoding wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ ri@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to encoding more than a WAV file simultaneously .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will set up and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is arranged on the hard disk , is set up in the preceding section .
since we use one &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from those for one &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained fre@@ ed@@ b data . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; to collect data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , the CD now needs to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen shot . this only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , consult the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers for help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully collected by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the artist &apos;s name and album name will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry , which in your opinion fits best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for individual comments as individual , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD .
note : after successfully retri@@ eving data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and to only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; k@@ audio creator .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help for enco@@ der to get more information .
just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tap@@ ered CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BO@@ M list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when clicking on the button Select the selection process started , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read@@ out and encoding occur parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . with high @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ not ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
as you know CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions have already pre @-@ compiled packages , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is intended for persons compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different other programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as to continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? anyone reading this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audio creator ; whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others , he has real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ - support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window can be drawn to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the used procedure .
session support . if you are &amp; k@@ de ; finish while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it will display the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also convert a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry Ab@@ play from the menu item or press the space key .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving it back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song texts , and some other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event sty@@ p is automatically determined which one song uses , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the Kara@@ oke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event sty@@ p , select the entries in text messages or lines from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 buttons .
a collection is a list of MIDI files you summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played by the series . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize ... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the wished in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub @-@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ arranged .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song back , select the button previous piece , select previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is not saved when leaving &amp; mid ;
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et &apos;s Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et events , making a trumpet sound when playing a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as many times as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer and support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section , you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the principle sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the concept drum patch the patch is meant , in which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some keyboard players own ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . see the provided key@@ map as an example .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name for this channel is needed . if you use the Key@@ map option , all events will be ignored , trying to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed . the value 40@@ 96 is used for no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM prof@@ esses that a keyboard that is a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event will play with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need a little bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try going around .
to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of piano creatures ( one for each MIDI @-@ channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not shine anymore in green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the point channel view : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
OK , so supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection before . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or plu@@ gged ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a file , just change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ; drag .
if you just want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ O.@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ de and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , that encourages me to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take some time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or , if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends from &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to point out that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E tickets was too high .
my thanks also include Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who has sent me a patch , an error correction or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ ge- / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with further kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile and mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE web site to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window of information that is only displayed when information is shown in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connection under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the permanent playlist category .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical position . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player directory can be edited by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the edit mode is abandoned or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; N &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ . &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / etc . / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / lt ; / etc .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player .
there is no tab for this playback device in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ zilla :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can render &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the setup dialog file Zu@@ ordnung ( K@@ DE ) .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the back@@ end edition is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
with that a pre@@ defined back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device must be configured and the TV channels need to be configured . in addition , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ e- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be recognized ports from which one is selected . the encoding used to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . )
internally , various names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ aul@@ dron .
is there any hints about how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as a user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom will show the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does every time my CPU need to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is hol@@ d. k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer needs the last saved value automatically , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . the installation should include the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact over the box should be established .
if you have any questions or if you compile &amp; Ki@@ le , please contact the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ;
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; posters .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( english lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to control &amp; lat@@ ex ; good books should e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 at present .
just like other drawing languages contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ start { document } and must be re @-@ closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry wizard from &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers a number of options for the creation of the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : here@@ with the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , Book &#91; Newsletter &#93; , Cover &#91; scroll &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ att@@ t &#93; , Book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ use &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; sc@@ r@@ use &#93; , She@@ ets &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be ro@@ uted ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they simply have to be rated in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with the German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editor - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you notice larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
with automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to execute the command ( e.g. \ \ end { instruction } ) . this function can be set in the settings box ; La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the mouse button , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked , is inj@@ ected at the corresponding location in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about Project Properties .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ready to grow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ .@@ After the quick construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick incorpor@@ ation of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; field is available for articles such as keywords , hints or references . the options available are : &quot; &quot; &quot;
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture , or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is shown with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; Ki@@ le , of course .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ h@@ et e is used for defining the font size . the font size can be specified for the main text , the columns , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ shut@@ ters contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the Quick Building button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically deleted .
if the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if it is not the case , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging of the document should also be followed .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest document . for example , a report with font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font .
changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , it can be added to certain fon@@ ts , fat , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c pressure and is as long as possible until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
after the background is shown to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . to this end , a quote , a few passages in the fat and cur@@ sive print and a poem , should be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a device @-@ independent file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar enables the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only modern under Settings box must set up ... Buil@@ d tools .
in order to execute pre @-@ set search , the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and can be cli@@ cked on target search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; - viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and inj@@ ected to the corresponding line .
should an error occur when using Schnell@@ bau ( s &amp; DVI ) viewers , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be summ@@ ar@@ ised in the log file or message window .
the log file will detect the source code in the source code . in the editor you can use the Pre@@ vious La@@ Te@@ X errors and bug reports for jumps between the errors . the log file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in logging has to be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the incorrect line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when choosing empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document ... Cre@@ ate a new template .
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings Gener@@ ally set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ programm class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , you can then select your own template instead of the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; Po@@ sters ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about it ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; posters .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very handy &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be called through the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double click with tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source code and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can add additional jumping marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ r@@ Ã ¤ t Edit champi@@ ons or the corresponding ke@@ yp@@ ad allows the jump to the next or last jump @-@ mark . thereby , this jump @-@ mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first entering of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; even though it offers excellent possibilities , in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; include always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
a paragraph is meant to include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning closes with tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word below the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a dotted line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course this can be selected first and by pressing the key Del . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to do select paragraph .
it has already been shown that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { surround } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering multiple ne@@ sted surrounding commands , quick overview can be lost . this command stops the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special orders for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front of or behind the spra@@ w@@ ling bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering multiple ne@@ sted groups @-@ par@@ enth@@ eses , quick overview can be lost . this command stops the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple suit marks are used as a gateway . for the expe@@ dient realization is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &apos; used for two simple reference marks . &apos; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and includes two closing quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of double landing characters can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X to be switched on and off .
it can also be used for foreign language settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French add marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; input button for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , t &amp; Ki@@ le closes ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already offering a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , it has been added to different modes . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Ki@@ le ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
at the beginning a new environment will begin with the command \ \ begin { setting } &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { setting } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input is removed and the complete list of letters can be reduced . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively from &amp; Ki@@ le ; you can also add jumping marks , so that a jump to these positions can be possible by editing the jump marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ est jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be added .

command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call for full @-@ space mode will result in a large list of environmental commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for full @-@ scale operation .
when calling the full @-@ scale operation over the menu item , or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically starts and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient recording can be continued in the simplest way and ending by pressing the input button .
once this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be frozen .
under Settings box ; set up ... box ; full @-@ time settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of execution mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of col@@ lars that are immediately replaced by more expensive strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of an output list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode has been initiated , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete registration for all already written orders .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... box can be switched off . here also the threshold value for the display of full @-@ scale termination can be specified .
the full @-@ volume files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / of the personal home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics add graphics to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangements of pages . if the PDF output is en@@ acted , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all the building tools are compiled in groups in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Gener@@ ate compile , create changes and create views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for the viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key element Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed into one PS file and be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will be opened each time .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface supplies the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will give you an lt ; empty signature ; in the signatures tab . if you typ@@ ed your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click the Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found in the desired working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files will be deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book then just leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ Book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they are simply checked . if not , they delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of a different file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed Review selection .
for using one &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , they choose &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the DT@@ D ; both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus has already been selected , you can simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
enter the name of the file as the result is named . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone to use the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and the button S@@ etze as expressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub@@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
ann@@ ot@@ ation is easy . either the note entry from the editor context menu is selected or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
comments can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project :
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ t- and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible through the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are :
big / Klein@@ caps are case @-@ sensitive by automatically inserted tags . normal cap@@ itali@@ zation means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
big / Klein@@ caps of attributes : upper@@ case of automatically inserted attribute . normal cap@@ itali@@ zation means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ ging XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
non @-@ optional tags automatically close : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish tag automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . restoring default values can be restored using the Standard button .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise known as the file opening of opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed over ) . however , this setting is stopped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regularly backup copies so that during a power ou@@ tage or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or documentation in a cart@@ el ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ root command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hook up of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source @-@ text views in its shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the mapping of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ cture tree Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree should be automatically opened . empty knots are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are grouped in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid PHP group where the if@@ dump short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plu@@ gins are K@@ s @-@ applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plugin , if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the inserted information is correct . select also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the button Options in addition to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin Sel@@ ection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the listening according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if a script is given , the execution will start as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include will be corrected .
tells de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there were not the current ones .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale and this part of documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can help you to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provide support for Mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain handy , symbolic tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see details for conversion .
this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialogue , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document with no risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bearing the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than a single element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common @-@ attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag edit dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but be mind@@ ful of &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tool dialog is at the top in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for achieving it via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = ver@@ min 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set by setting actions ... to be created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
the selected key short@@ cut , attached to this action . by clicking on the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or portions of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This is how &amp; qu@@ anta / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / is removed from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced by P@@ GD of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be used by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the selection field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , run to the default output output . it can be specified , what should be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the value the sel@@ ector output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in a given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
enter all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphi@@ c other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size andern .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , num@@ b , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; press the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog about settings tool@@ bars . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
back to the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in root folders , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
loop of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # prior to Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but be mind@@ ful of &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file attachment lines .
a simple list of context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in various places there is an email send menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with Email , send tool@@ bars tool@@ bar with Email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download it . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . to make a lon@@ ge@@ vity , we recommend using the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start clicking OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is not currently supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , by creating a D@@ TE@@ P package . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in XML format . there is the easiest way to convert a DT@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Description : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; adjusted . it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for anyone , who &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars about actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to everyone in a multi@@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the project folder tree , which em@@ powers the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the learning boxes with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for more detailed information on these areas .
you can click the right mouse button to get a context menu matching the current document , such as closing the current , other or all file fron@@ trun@@ ners , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marking or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click on the editing pane will lead to another context menu for the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copying / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or opening the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the symbol that represents the tag . now you can enter the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the project views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate , open and strip information in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with file operators are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scripts . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here too . by clicking the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technique for your development to be found . it can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can project specific documentation , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two flash@@ backs at the bottom of the window where useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts which are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the way to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed t@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allow auto@@ conf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PA@@ TH in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while striving to create the best &amp; HTML ; Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus would be an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why does anyone else develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only possible but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly evolved to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta execute ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ ett Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there contain special characters for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; HTML &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; sc@@ rub which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
disman@@ tling and turning the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with a file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , projects you will find the details .
load a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved by settings dialog ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you are asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows the loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be fresh@@ ened without rene@@ wing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a standard sub@@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar means that this day is contradic@@ ting the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the Po@@ sters ; -@@ Version .
very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS , or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or unpleasant graphic . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode representing the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a single entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of posters , one finds details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add them and change row sequences .
this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse model , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out best from top to bottom , as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except one processes local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the location of the remote machine , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
note that if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew , do not hook up .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the files you want by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree menu in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings are similar to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ indicates , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set using the Options button . troubleshooting is described in .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window profile upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing an own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , modify , or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select project open ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project supervision gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password is retained in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to program@@ ing . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ reliable password on the disk do not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be shown :
this is the name of the server on which the files shall be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety @-@ wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply swap the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted in the project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best can be st@@ acked by menu tool@@ bars . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated at the bottom in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and icons on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions can be removed , tool@@ bars , or tool@@ bars can be executed , which will be displayed in the dialog where you can specify which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bars .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , entries will be removed and action worked , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set Settings actions .. Set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates in principle like a usual fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or merge any directory existing on the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in some the limitations you present for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; delivered templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information about the Tem@@ plate Tree is available .
documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . typically , more specialized documents are stored in corresponding sub@@ folders . you do a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , combined in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book , etc . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate Save As a local template .
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged with drag &amp; drop to the construc@@ tional view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or project files , you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template to enter and back a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamically use &amp; PHP ; create , insert files , or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template view , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a sel@@ ector with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as the par@@ ental attribute has been inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set like that , it would disable templates in this path unless explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows leading or imagined text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second editor divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source @-@ editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ PL / source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is activated , this mode is already active , offset the active cur@@ sor from a window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the Synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor is configur@@ able using the Qu@@ anta settings .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , you can adjust the time interval . in principle , the recommendation is : a small gap for fast computers and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you can choose document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is created . this is useful for the reduction of the manual coding .
met@@ a @-@ tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
cur@@ sors are used like in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves curi@@ ously . the marking works as usual .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool bar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags is not removed previously already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed by any other ambient anch@@ ors tag .
some tool@@ bars like the Table Wiz@@ ard or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet is executed .
to be able to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path@@ name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded sty@@ list file name with relative path to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command is checked for partial or full compliance with a template called my@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any of the my@@ ME template that contains the template template .

adds the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables .
execute the conversion 20 times if --@@ repeat is twice as specified , the conversion will be executed 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML .
enables the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML . this is enabled as default
on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the exp@@ iry of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; the argument is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template consisting of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name can have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short@@ cut for the personal folder . other environment variables are allowed on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; PA@@ TH : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ~ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot; &quot; &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ? ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
merging was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small nightmare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when automatically selecting the correct changes . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o destination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o destination folders
the open dialogue enables manual typing of file names , selecting via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog reveals your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
if you select a folder , the same or merging folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , but a folder for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other folders .
when merging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting the same / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison then starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and inser@@ ting text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the Info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white marks are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line , which separates the abstra@@ cts column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are enabled , the line is shown on broken lines .
the results window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ge@@ aring &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains already text by automatically merging text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons below to find the un@@ solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merging conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate will mainly be navig@@ ated with the screen strips and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side , start , end , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can use it from other programs .
in the drop window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the Coll@@ aboration and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture Down ) or the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must automatically copy the Copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is checked , whatever you tick is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is not required . however , be careful with this option , as you could acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences in itali@@ c font are displayed . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed straight . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically creates an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab sign is inserted .
if you press input or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board is dispens@@ ed with .
you can choose which line @-@ ending type you prefer to save . pre @-@ set value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white characters may be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when merging , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , while others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return character , but then treated like a white character . while merging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . as a result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white characters .
this option is de@@ activated in default . changes in comments are treated as changes in white notes .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . check for details on how to compare and merge documentation .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version will be added to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must stop &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; exit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if this option is checked , the upper setting is used for all entries .
a brief note of the local encoding appears above the boxes for coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , they may not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white notes in the text or summary columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column are displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal , second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other or overl@@ apped . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as the pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this feature is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command processor .
the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated from $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line offset . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ reset / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , some details are different with per@@ l . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for viewing and merging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm provides .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but like any feature that changes text or hide differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively and merge them together .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as the basis . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be notified of a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
every file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ click on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and All sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open and fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red , green , yellow and black .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders also have the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , merging can not be started .
the synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merging and storing the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; directly copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then check &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
during merge , one file is processed one by one . status column shows Fer@@ tig when merging was successful , and correspon@@ dingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK everywhere .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C will be used as the destination , in the two @-@ folder merge , B will be chosen as destination and for synchron@@ izing A and / or B will be used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also displayed in the folder structure . there are some options by which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) to merge the current element : select the action of the current element , or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Per@@ forman@@ t , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window will open ( notice the screen@@ shot ) .
if you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then continue &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you stum@@ ble on a bug , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , let &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later merging of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered as completed .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . there can be several patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignore files , which would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be specified with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ or . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a preceding dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
in case of links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equally large . this can be useful for example when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed to be the knowledge that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only merging whole folders . this option is turned on in default .
usually the folder merge view is visible in the merging of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der to the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window into main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views via switch between directory &amp; text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is a corresponding menu entry in the menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to merge the folder together . once you save the result , the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ AP@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then there will always be a file as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fying date . therefore , per@@ missions or the modification date depend on the original . ( note the option of Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; 2 complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then it starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the ke@@ part mode .
there already exist tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to do it this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3 u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines change next to each other , this is the case .
the editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c won ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3 sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties arise , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ oval ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift insert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position respectively replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the update feature after changes to these options . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also causes identical files to merge in the destination folder . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed when you click on the button .
this option is disabled in default . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white notes .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on work@@ tops , change their size , quit or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other work@@ spaces .
the context menu relies on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and End . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; show the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is displayed along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .

you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a portion of the screen , as if you read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ line at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter into the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key , or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the drop@@ down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop@@ down window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very Low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button File re@@ load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and sh@@ red@@ ding &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ ex@@ fier ; is a screen @-@ pump . you can use &amp; k@@ ex@@ fier ; to use one area of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visual handic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor holds a while in the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Diseases ) and inflic@@ t pain on every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse button freezes for a while on the same spot . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and inflic@@ t pain on any mouse click . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
if the mouse button is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is carried out . in this way , you can drag the pull with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute .
if Intel@@ ligent reloc@@ ation is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; once the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button freezes , if no moving is done .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving leads to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mou@@ sec@@ lick , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may , if necessary , reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which areas a mou@@ sec@@ lick without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions .
if your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to create a keyboard . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can deal with it . it is very likely to highlight text , copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert it or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : drag one click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and re @-@ click the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will trigger each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when you move the smart move the delay time begins . later , you can use the intelligent slide without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
in order to be able to use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker , and they are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; right @-@ click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is in a nut@@ shell . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured for a certain amount of time waiting for a pulling process to begin before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping with the mouse can also be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can select sets from a list with the conversation history to be spoken once again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the installation dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages used without typing it . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory storage of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have correctly aligned mouth , you can input the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken phrase is attached to the memory memory . you can select phrases which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page wor@@ ding as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the learning flash@@ card , you enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box under the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed down as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ales as a voice service &amp; mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardis@@ ed interface for voice output and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . selecting this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu Aut@@ ot@@ ext entries or in the list of text passages .
with the choice of instant speech , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the memory space . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only in the input field .
with the second selection field closing the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
the book stores the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be stored .
the page wor@@ ding contains a list of words for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the cho@@ oser area .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books can be added or selected text passages and books can be accessed either through the selection in the menu bar , tool@@ bar or drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the process memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences will be used .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is placed by default above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding box for text passages can be displayed with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
you probably did not have the command for voice output correctly or not fully entered . open setting k@@ mouth ; set up the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card language issue . ( see settings dialog for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a speech output system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the festival free of charge without any restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to propag@@ ate without restrictions .
in order to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etz folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as a default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ st and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo $ ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ st / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the language edition dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ales as a voice service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to set the setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog from &amp; mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak , can print text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions can be saved , which the user can always re @-@ write again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doesn &apos;t contain speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the machine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start the help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules that allows every application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS abilities . also users it offers interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; posters ; even if &amp; plac@@ ards ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications embedded .
speech output is performed via the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program , which uses various background software such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , etc .
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or shell scripts ) using the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the speech output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; posters ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ zilla database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the node @-@ accessibility mailing list . you can also subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use kt@@ ts ; you will need to install and correctly adjust the speech utility program .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is established , the card menu is indicated . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card is General displayed .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . a so @-@ equipped combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is called speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to several printer expectations for the same printer .
when you click on the card holder in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . this will also appear automatically , if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all the speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ops system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can almost use it . go back to the card shelf and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled for the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can and kt@@ ts ; use orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language release system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab in the General to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map menu will display orders and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar while reading , it disappears once the read is complete .
with buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause and resume text orders .
with buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for one job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cart@@ on card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General and tick the language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check whether &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should be read , and select Tools Text from the main menu .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; outs ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that should be read , and select Tools Text from the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also functions if &amp; plac@@ ards ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of events that you specified . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel in which your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for string fixing offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or fla@@ wed messages can be corrected . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from messages sent to K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters text is processed before being sent to the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation to replace wrong@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the delivery of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the sustained orders will be continued .
warning has the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning is priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
news has the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you are &amp; eg ; a long text can be read on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the edition of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads this output will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be provided with pre@@ defined text string replacement filters , which facilitate the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ation of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML , from one format to another format . included in &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with subscri@@ ber selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is used for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; - Noti@@ fication to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following installation di@@ alogs will be displayed .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a reference sample for setting up characters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Cre@@ ating . the list is processed from top to bottom in the ordered sequence .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text application one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of a mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will be provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter .
the string replacement filter is applied only to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs can be found in the package ch@@ un@@ uti@@ ls .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to shap@@ ely XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PA@@ TH , it is enough to reach x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter lets you send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties which the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers arranged on the card board speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button to the right to show the dialog of Spe@@ akers .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request language output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ Window . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the above @-@ mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my speech . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my speech ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also , make sure that the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found using the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the correct language for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a character replacement filter .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ f@@ accessibility package , from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will also find the source code of k@@ de@@ bug under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS works with every speech synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a &amp; kon@@ sole .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on kt@@ ts website ; , for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customiz@@ able module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the package k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are referring to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; translate from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bug or download the tar@@ ball you created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check if speech synthes@@ izer works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech emul@@ ators is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can undo the sentence , repeat , pause , pause , or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be the best suitable spokesperson . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
when you click Ad@@ ding to add a speaker to the list , and then click Edit , the Cart@@ ei@@ card Spe@@ aker setup will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules you will find below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only need to enter festival .
select the sign coding for text that is passed to festival . for voices that are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , using Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider controls you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and show this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when the K@@ TT@@ SD is started so that the first movement is synthes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed when starting kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that set the job , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card speaker .
with buttons in this row , you can pre @-@ select or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
by clicking OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please see .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or kt@@ ts without support for the appropriate audio module ; can &apos;t load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you chose AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ ml ; % like double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take over the new settings for the running and running system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device will work with you . in case of doubt , choose standard .
on this card card you can set up special promotions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice records :
the delivery of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after reading the edition of the screen reader , the reserved orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that messages messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the edition of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output is included in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both introductory sound and introductory message are active , the introductory sound will be played prior to the introductory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; Start K@@ not@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card menu will appear .
check this check box to enable &amp; k@@ de to read ; if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; kon@@ verse ; sends whenever someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown as the top entry in the list on the card menu speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival Con@@ figuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds do not divide text into single phrases . this allows you to start or stop jobs faster with reading , since only the first movement must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit detection filter is set up automatically as a default . you can modify its settings or add further pro@@ positions recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker sel@@ ector by sample . turn on the selection of speakers and select text to read . switch on the selection menu again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection is changed .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can stop or cancel text orders on the map menu , even if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function .
for these reasons , the normal movement recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
Stat@@ ute recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tori@@ als and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set detection filter retains the character set @-@ up .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( bother ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set detection filter by mistake , you can re @-@ paste it by rel@@ o@@ ading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top@@ most on the card speaker ) . in other words , no speech characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a subscri@@ ber . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the original set of speakers .
select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the speaker &apos;s properties here . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker section , which is best to delete the following , click on the standard speaker tool@@ bar and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I have compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .

I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows not this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program needs to be installed as x and can be discover@@ able by the environment variable PA@@ TH . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ module such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hap@@ ing filter , and set up the speech speed .

I have added an own character replacement filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer prec@@ ede or return . on the back of the box , orders are displayed , the order only consists of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question marks , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional recognition instead .

before you use it , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option coding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes on the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language release system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates speech from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder / li@@ b / . instructions can be found at

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module will display network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to select from the list that best matches the distribution and rele@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting No @-@ again requests the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of network settings this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administrator mode . before , all options are gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system administrator mode , you can enter system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in the system administrator mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box to be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options .
with the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
the choice Manu@@ ell can configure the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net@@ mask must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching on a switched @-@ out network device is selected by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the machine in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows for easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in priority by selecting a single entry or down@@ gra@@ ding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list named above describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some well known machines , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... Add New alias dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well known machine has multiple alias names , press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of an especially known machine from the list and select Edit .... The dialog to edit your computer will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , it is sufficient to install Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ sheets ; change configuration files will be discussed .
in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed to a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found a wide spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to get through in the near future , so this description is currently focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are mostly used in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 128 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this part contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is handled by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another state than expected can therefore occur .

alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Copy , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C .
to insert an environment variable , first you have to cut or copy one into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then is the In@@ sert option available at all . select the variable folder . then , go to Edit In@@ sert .
to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then go to Edit Change .... Altern@@ atively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and modify ... Select , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; O . then the dialog box appears , in which , as described above , you can edit the variable .
to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete .
to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit button menu item . if a de@@ activated variable appears , de@@ activated by description .
alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ ables . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly .
if all tasks and environment variables have been inserted or altered , you need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select File Save .
alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; s . changes or additions to tasks or variables only become active .
it will display the standard k@@ de ; print dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .

&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first one was to create a tar surface that provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective delivery . the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be included in &amp; dat file ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; reco@@ vers the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; dat ; don &apos;t recognise the default on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; dat file ; the default , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape was resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; dat .
a tape format must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat file . if your tape drive is format@@ ted before use , this must be done before you can be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , whereas DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape are lost . after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you launch the backup procedure , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files listed in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up Settings for backup . in this dialog , you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will display backup . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select menu entry ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review .
if you confirm the settings for verification , the dialog appears to Veri@@ fy . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will display settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
when you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears restore . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types from the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the kno@@ bs files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ un@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat file ; before the tape is included , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; dat file ; to lock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the band will automatically dis@@ connect &amp; dat file ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; dat file ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ full block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; dat file ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat file ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar @-@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , it enables &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ System@@ log enables experienced users to access , for example , information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching , and k@@ System@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not to have system administrator rights . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered string . in addition , enter a string in the filter bar . in the default setting , the sel@@ ector contains next to the filter the entry All . then a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filtering bar , so show you and k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than protocol lines of the level hint . the colored display of protocol lines can be turned off .
if you want to view a particular process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filtering bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add @-@ to @-@ line option in the main window context menu to display all new rows in the next rows .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux world . and that is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to boot when you run the system or change to a different run@@ level . system services don &apos;t include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls are r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something at boot , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel tries in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could have a user run@@ level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ level@@ ing or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target zone -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator key to enable the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cli@@ pping into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . include the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
specify the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplify the configuration for the proprietary programming of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up in@@ correctly .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you have made changes , you must save it . either , use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a flash@@ card is created where you can set individual settings . more flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD UNIX .
the password management card appears if shadow passwords or / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD UNIX .
this file only appears , if for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable from the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here parameters may be changed for each user , with the space constraints contained in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the array file system with space limitation .
the card card groups inform you about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the standard group to which the user is heard can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ eric group field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , highlight this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and change the boot password , change the time to the bo@@ oting of the default operating system , add , remove , add , add , add , remove , modify , and more .
