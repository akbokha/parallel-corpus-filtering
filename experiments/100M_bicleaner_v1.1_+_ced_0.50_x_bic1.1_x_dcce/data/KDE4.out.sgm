<seg id="1">"" "the module" "" "translate website" "" "can be found in the & konqueror; menu on Tools web page. select the starting and target language of the translation from the drop-down list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish in the best case produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can insert texts to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror, by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Guide to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings extensions... Open the card menu Tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default settings modules from the box kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, which & konqueror has crashed, or the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module rudder filter (also called the folder filter) can be found in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM Tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, example: documentitems, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbolic and text views in order to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in showing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected, even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap account representing a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either show depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and thus, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always kept. it is drawn to show the nesting of the entries, and this frame will need space that will not be available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the space of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses by setting the area in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal area for an entry on the menu entry View Views on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module gallery, a dialog opens with which you can specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text entry field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Images per line has a slider and a rotating field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">The file name of the image shows whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "to view the file size of the image, see if the file size is displayed in the gallery under the thumbnails." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you can determine if the size of the images is displayed in the gallery in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog box, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the" "" "Save in HTML file" "" "file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can adjust with a slider or a rotating field, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">If you want to copy the original pictures to the gallery, you can copy the original pictures into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can use the annotation box annotation file to specify a comment text for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box's own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find the media reproduction for the navigation area in the & konqueror; menu under Windows navigation pane, or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browser detection now adds a menu entry in & konqueror, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that gives access to this browser, change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the identifier in MSIE for pages that decline access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry insert... you can set the scope of information on the used browser and operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">The module website can be checked in the & konqueror; menu checked under Extras website. you can make the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; document the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found bugs are displayed. with this test you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style templates embedded in HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Check the links on your page on further instructions and faulty links. recursively, all links are reviewed on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archiving for & konqueror, you can save websites with text and images in the .was format.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "click" "" "Archive" "" "with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed web page." ""</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digicam; -Albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will be with & digicam; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with considerably more metadata, such as & eg; on the camera or lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digicam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">Where ever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes report.... This will open a dialog with a signed link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is listed here. just follow the instructions to submit your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicode; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digicam; then we'd like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digicam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for submission in the developer mailing list by & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter your path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digicode; will also be used as an alpha library. settings digitisam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images, as a basic folder. & digicode; view any subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. while browsing the folder, you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; searches recursively for the library path throughout its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this allows you to insert extra-bs & digicam; do it by inserting a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a basic folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as icons. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digicam; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My sampling box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">The support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy to use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and upload your photos directly to & digicam; -Albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will be with & digicam; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE 1394 or i-Link). the camera then appears as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">GPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to machines and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection has become obsolete. & digicode; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digikam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI module: the KDE Image Plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to developing a common module structure for & digicam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicam; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digicam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the alumertree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selector allows you to emphasize the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter will only work on the file name only if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digicam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, by the name of their collection in the Albenthic properties or after the date the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imported scanners. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select to edit album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort out your photos, if you want to add or delete collections from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Buttons elders, average, New Year: these put the date on that of the oldest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digipt, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; it will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select in context menu & quot; As a album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicode; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the My keywords list on the left side of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all the photos of the album.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the frame window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnail images are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools All preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can choose to edit settings; set up the albums page and customize the thumbnail area to suit your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The screenshot shows the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the section Introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digicam; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... Select. in the section edited; image editing you can see instructions on how to edit your photos. image editing lets you view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image. this is why this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicode; provides two possibilities for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digicam; delete it will be moved into the trash bin from & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My date list; organizes your photos by using the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the data view so that only the photos of the days chosen will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keywordlist; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords in the loss of the database are re-imported as soon as & digicam; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My sampling rate; or click on an existing keyword, and then select new keyword. if you click on an existing keyword after you click on an existing keyword, it becomes the substitchword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword, drag it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting the keyword in the keyword menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My studs.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My studs. alternatively, you can also click the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to him. in this way you can assign a keyword for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right click the context menu of the photo and select from the keyword menu. the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timately adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit. this will display all the corresponding pictures in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small lamp that turns green when the search matches hits. when you click here, the filtering is deleted and all the pictures are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is shown in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search that always filters what you have entered as search criteria. after you have been saved, it appears in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and search will be performed. the results will be displayed in My Search List in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form to enter the search again appears with the search information entered previously. if you select Add as advanced search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. here you can find more information in the section The tool for Advanced search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicode; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb database. all rules will be added to / searched by operators. any option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleting or deleting them. additionally, you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicam; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area in which you can drop each image to find a similar. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it down there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digicam; find the matching images. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out zooming with the mouse wheel. move it while you click the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your Geo Filter. this will then be added for a later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicode; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem illuminator add from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window open. if you are back in & digicode; main window are, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place it. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then these are also executed in the other picture.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out a series of images. if you are using pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas of the same. now use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it on the left side. this simplifies it to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal extinguishing operations also work directly from the lamp table such as F4 File Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the main window of the main window is available for both thumbnail images in the light table. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to turn the visible area of the picture, you have to click these and hold the & LMB; in the mode preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom is the same as in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zooming out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of us records, scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures, find, protect and use photographs again. we will focus on the procedures for digital photographer the & digicam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectures and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data via data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to find a certain photo no longer without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digicam;. the approach can store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving, which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you sort out anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found on your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you want to print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option metadata to be saved in the settings page of the Metadata Editor. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? for this, & digicam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign each picture keywords, labels and a rating. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then the tree will be set up for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by pulling one subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata can overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to see your photos, they want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you are sure about how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing place of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you might even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer, to help Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is alright if a picture is not perfect, if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can store as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as label. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolokement are countless and will be even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys through images with geographic indications.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and denotes the practice copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information was written in the direction page of & digicam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo, e.g. to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support either commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work designation of the photographer. examples of this may be titles such as: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for providers): use the bidder field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a camp photo, then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change these, embedded in the image. for private individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digicam; will in the near future provide such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, record loss, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we have problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you need to be treated careful and you may not be trusted longer than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and sound recorders and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. so it's about selecting the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you are just written. this is why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For corrupt CDs and DVDs, there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media with a description, date & author and then copy it to a clean, dark dry and wildlife-protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discotors keep their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives: disclaimer study</seg>
<seg id="187">Breaches are the most frequent error reason, SMART is the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors identified by SMART terminate the imminent failure. these are especially reading errors and encampments. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only a complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't make a lot of power collisions, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high-speed processor. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause blocked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy heat and earns the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, that not every connector also includes overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you look for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning strikes and thus protect the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should make sure that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactor that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coax cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against surge voltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and run down the system. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can be used for less than & euro; 40. at the end, remember to always remember all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you have to send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are based on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies, the offer includes a backup and a distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under one license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on the notebook and 46% in workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden break during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that as technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more impaired. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so do not blame anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data often after a plan and test this backup before you have anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups daily on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash is struck, you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget an airspace: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring up your fuses up the stairs, into the neighbour house, into your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above is a common reason for data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete assurance and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. produces multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images just after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This method allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC information stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">For valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or adolescence, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to forwards a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the fewer varieties you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should already be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualisation is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have entered the scalability and the area you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">With the command dmesg, check if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBI; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc # change the size of row if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software available, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages pictures in high quality, but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG. the digital Negative file format is a license-free and open source image format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blockade; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpgt; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording, most of the time in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. but it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and place it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the map reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera beam, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digicam; edit, then you should add the metadata again. they may be cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrights with a digital watermark. export them only in web galleries, encoding in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digicam; in the addition of a photo to an album, you can add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Alb database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use it, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. with some cameras this can take a while. if the connection is established, a Fertig indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notices, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the editing pane's metadata page bar; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digicam;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we suggest you check if the photos were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download selected. the selected button is grayed out until you selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digicode; downloaded. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you download the All or Selected Files button, a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums will be displayed in the section My Albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digicam; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the Delete button. if you want to delete only a few, you have to select them first and then delete the selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera, so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully taken into a & digicam; you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera name, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can result in double filenames, if you upload photos of different shooting galleries to the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made to integrate into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder per day will be created automatically.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer, three other options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information into the IPTC squares. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when downloading. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. its settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicode; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to the point of time recording to perform automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and when your camera does not provide this information, it lets & digicam; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are uploaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case saving & digicode; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, use this option. use the Advanced button and select Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">When the image selection is done, asks & digicam; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in latitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser with a click that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitones and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a couple working with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel, but you need to save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic allocation module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page, you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script using the Exit Tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals to create hasty coordinates, for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicode; tries to give you so much control over its working procedures as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digicam; change. in order to access these settings, you must be edited in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing are set. thus, you set the default behavior of & digicam; note when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author: this field should include the professional description of the photographer. this can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a closer description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as these the picture is a camp photo, then the group or agency should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rim. this will ensure that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the & digicode database; this metadata is also available in other programs and can be exported in & digicode; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image captions as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the lettering embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse-pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicode; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digicode; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Each time you open the table, these settings are not available. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, you can only get better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it's meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value on high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF-files option, you can switch the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the loss-loss setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digicode, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present, it is very quickly developing into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a little bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect of underexposed images in four steps more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images are burned down, because of the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as a penetrating white. the setting colors trigger some unusual results because it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red. & digicam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the restrution option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digicam; image processing. in order to minimize the time for the demo-icing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw present three alternatives: bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests, it looks like AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, as it is carried out during the blanking conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back. there is also LCMS and & digicam; for information such as colour information from a color space to translate into the other, the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Follow the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; default squire; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures color does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma is not corrected for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate as your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture, as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on Canon's models. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a set of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digicode; many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will be loaded by & digicam; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controls adjust the time between the transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into / off, which appears at the lower end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all supported cameras on the left side. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the picture-line mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check whether & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; View images in the trash bin, you can set the conversation of & digicam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find further details in the deletion of a photo and deletion of an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side of the page can be tacitly deleted by & digicode; applied if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any questions. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">"" "you can also display the" "" "welcome screen" "" "screen, stopping at startup. this speeds up the opening process from & digicam;." ""</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When start looking for new photos is forced & digicam; the base folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time from & digicam;. when something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digicam; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digicode; used to match the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digicode; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicode; you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the section image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, which displays file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo, before you have used File Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the button The button Restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last backup.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any action of image editing can be undone or restored, and the last action can be undone by modifying or restores editing by selecting reproducing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to remember.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the undo / restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adapt a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you get to the normal view where you can use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can also change it in the settings dialog by & digicam; you can call it from the & digicode; main window. see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select print wizard from the menu Exports. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicam; main window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigation files, also available in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters will be changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the user button, or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Strg + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The assessment is written in the IPTC field urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a box with the keywords used in this & digicode; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further simplification when entering keywords in a series of images. if you typed different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword (s) can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Keyword Tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filters page is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keywords and search views. if additionally one or more keywordfilters from the right side are used, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on No words, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and after that a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings OtherMiscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it would have to be one or it, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry according to which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, picture, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already placed in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an Advanced search on all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written primarily by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digicam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that reflect the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the subject comes to color management, then everybody wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflow. in addition, links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other images are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to worry about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB compared to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the two-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor because sRGB believes that your monitor is on sRGB. if you work as in the sRGB colour space, then you need to connect your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, offset, automatic offset and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try to make the most of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminance values over the entire image so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without changing its shade.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similarly, nearly every brightness range has the same number of pixels. sometimes the balance has very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright bordertone and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histograms area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a new arrangement of all values in between. this is only visible with well-balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because working with an 8-bit colour space. so if you are too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they launch it via the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right up, a histogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or decrease the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance. this way, also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The stores save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">Here you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the Colors Sound Editor menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to store multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; tool color effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar rotation effect, a suvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash beam and afterwards the development of the image was completed. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar plexus. at about 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase in the picture eventually creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it brightens many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a light-optimized film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide reps the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to change the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color spots of your photo with the tools in the menu under Color. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too great saturation. in this case too, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">The tool tonvalue correction is located between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you only need the section of the slider for the application cited here. concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph, three slides are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the knob and watch how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box you can set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear representation is often the most useful. in images the large areas of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the uppermost one for the dark tones, the medium for the bright tones and the lowest for the mid frequencies, commonly called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with input values. for example, the compression of output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: these buttons can store the set values in the filesystem and load them later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you are using this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shades, medium and bright colors. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the Luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most meaningful. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve section to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright sounds correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photo is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: these buttons allow you to do exactly this. each curve that you have created can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">Select the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and Sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digicam's channel mixer; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shade of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel Mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">Using the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line will appear in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color. colored is made up of small noise files that don't appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the processed picture under (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Sound 4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenticular filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lenticular filter. this enhances landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. similarly, like the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiachian: produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiphus. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensional texture of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textile effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to set the image a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. add under picture frame the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, adjust the desired frame type for your image. the picture with a colored line, niepce surround it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttoning effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The frame decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool Folding the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in a picture at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the larger the image, the larger the character set must be.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template can be used in image processing can be used to place stencils via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil template, just send an email to the & digicam; mailing list digicam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button Base Folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the stencils, a tree view appears which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the thumbnail of the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge This button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your picture. the picture will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each one of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, granular images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture blurred. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychoeducational. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitization process of colours with minimal differences to one color. elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined to form a common color. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the home user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often applied in internal sharpness. in contrast, pictures in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable them, you will get the control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness tool. this can be called with the menu entry Correction Follow.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image refocus. you can refocus on the menu entry correcting. under refocus you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the soft sign tool with the menu entry Corrigieren softeners and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried at first. an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blurred mask to strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a channel. high-resolution images permit larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum of the RGB value and the difference-amount. this allows for a minimum difference to be applied to a duct of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from sharpness and therefore flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp masking was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted deflation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus mostly achieves better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, circular folding works much better than the palatal cleavage. the palatal cleavage has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also depending on the source pixel, which is far from the original torment pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter when your blurred Gauß is. this is most commonly caused by a previously performed Unkefe Filter. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß 'sharpness. however, please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The save as and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all cutting, color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before otherwise altering the picture. the reason for this is that many operations are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress pictures, and eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, vagabely masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the blurring of a larger neighbourhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimum linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the follow-up methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob regulates the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most sophisticated tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Incorporation algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings to use.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is required afterwards. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordinate to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Alignment Addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film or CCD noise will generate a high value wavy pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. usually 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle measurement range [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. be aware that small angles create a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by choosing this option is only minimal. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The stores save as and load exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be corrected in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting picture errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with small artefacts removed. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable picture filters to remove stains and other artifacts from e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel is required and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the filter frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a faint noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more distorted, but also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius is reacted to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is labeled (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was used with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften softener with the menu entry Corrigieren softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artifacts Reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The stores save as and load exactly this. each setting of photo restorations can be stored in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures have been applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicam; tool Hotpixel enables the Hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera close to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression are equipped with built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically reload it to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duress: an average of neighboured pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is visible below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, because otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">Using digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying a equivalent transformation to a picture that was made without this filter. the tool vignetting grading applies the transformation with a crank filter to an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting correcting filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0mm, which causes an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly of a light intensity of 2, lower it to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma setting: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lentils on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second graph treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar circular effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grading corrects the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion of the second graph. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion can be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth graph. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameters' has the reversed mark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows a preview of distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. ideally, perform this correction first. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be apparent to the groove.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal line of help. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you rectify a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the Edit menu from image editing or via the Zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera manually, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2) can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film by the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IIR film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob influences the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter blends color channels for producing infrared film, especially the green channel it doesn't make sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. in order to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix big silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The picture gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more kernels, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film sample effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Glätte 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicam; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradient to create a carbon sketch. the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper slider selects the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adapting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicam; Filter engraving influences your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digicam; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave Block 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Block 2: analogously to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using the sound effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurring the image along star-shaped lines starting from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by rotating the pixels to a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurr: blurbs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurbs the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softer sharpness: blurred the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blurred: blurred the image by random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent weed: finds the farmyard in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can choose with the & digicam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. the tools can be found in the menu Transformieren Turning / Transformieren Spiegels.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how to get the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use some kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retained aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. every single image for photo magnification can be stored as a text file and then loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small paint image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear enlarged enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool in order to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and moving the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the blank, use the button The Ctrl button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File menu entry in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the rectangle size by moving the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or a landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool Folding the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area to cut to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio, it saves its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed picture dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination help make it possible to hide help, so that you can better compose your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to share a rectangle squared in a similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden mean: the golden mean is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this type.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, gold triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal on these lines can be placed a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Editor's Horizontal Panels are used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it is easy to keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option makes the image smoothing a little bit after the turn. but be aware of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is blurred a little. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The firing tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and shift the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the top part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using horizontal angles and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture will get a little blurred. for a single lubrication, this effect is mostly negligible, but two insulators produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the drawing, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicode; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the formats available depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are available in & digicode; your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise reduction, refocus, blurring, etc;. use a uniform dialogue type which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applicable; in this dialogue:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally, without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the left lower corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information on the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are derived from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out zooming with the mouse wheel. move it while you click the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes files that are installed by & kde can be applied either for the whole system or just one user. in the latter case they are in your Personal Folder for & kde; Settings and hot user defined color and last unused colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">The color is described under the Pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box bym Cursor is activated under the button Color, the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites another; depending on whether the mode is overwrite selected. this mode can be set by selecting the crossing field overwrite under Beim Cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy, Cut and Insert.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character, if another color follows. if there are three figures in the clipboard, these can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphene is used in science, especially in computer science. up to now there was no modern & GUI; -program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; contains, are outdated according to the program author & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graph. the & graphviz; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI;</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & makes; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & ates; recounts the graph and represents in & kgraph;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & outs; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphic viewer; in one & placards; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot and a hack to show more than these knot)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program, which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for representing the graph presupposes. needs are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kbarviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">Once you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner, if the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited by factor 10 in both directions. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphic viewer; can also remember your decision so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Settings kgraph viewer; set up... see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside a running & kgraphic viewer; & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kypviewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it afterwards with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. once again, you can save your choice as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be split up to several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming to a page should be adapted to this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled with the relevant parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages without headline and another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable load page gives the option to set the behavior when a file is changed to disk, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the option to set the behavior of & kpersonviewers; specify if a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the option to set the start behavior of & kpersonviewers; you can specify a default behavior (open or not) the files of the last session or specify to be asked for each startup.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBN; opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard graph. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-numerical graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the jump-spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a spring model for ungerized graphs. it uses the Fruitman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, which will then be executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphite file as a parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give and eg the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (judged or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for non-directed graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan Images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">If you can scan the images from the menu entry, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by clicking the default ducer's default values to select your image. watch the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you press the scan button, wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears. remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the menu Importier- &gt; screen shot... a window will appear in which you can set the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the complete desktop read only the window under the mouse is read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options dialog appears with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management online. Flickr allows you to send photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world showing your camera images online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module Export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication, so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in at Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successfully logging in, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you press Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other authorizations. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking on the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Familly options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. the above-looking dialog appears. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera function must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera function. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for pictures, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpoling and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have suitable data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button Correlation to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog reveals the coordinates of one call to the next, you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set by the displayed map. select the region and enlarge sie.Do this again and again until you reach a sufficient accuracy. the altitude must be selected manually. the map can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums which should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization possible.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right-hand side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be created in which the picture will be displayed. otherwise the picture will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">"" "the tab" "" "thumbnail" "" "allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails which are small images displayed in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the messages to determine if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will be automatically started to preview the gallery. press close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or sliding. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found in the PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera button is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV to the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed among image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the grading of the images respectively the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds to show a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, a high, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start the production of the movie with the button coding. depending on the speed of your machine, you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slide show if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages through the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats, JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file which should be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option will determine whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for that.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion by executing button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to override existing files. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can shrink the image or enlarge. there are four types of image changes made available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dot): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 diam.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Press Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo apiece. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. additional images can be drawn to the list of images to be sent and put off there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be shown with the pictures selected by you. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview of the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop them to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button remove pictures, the selected images are removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images selected by you are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it might be a good idea to send emails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. their configuration is stored and each time used until you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After choosing comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu Images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG among images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifers are added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is ready, the window is not automatically closed so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program is automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">"" "after starting the" "" "Advanced Diaschau" "" "module, a window appears with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the albums you selected and all the images of the album." ""</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation activates very elegant transitions using OpenGL. however, you need to have an appropriate graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the option" "" "File Name Display" "" "ensures that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. afterwards, you can cancel it manually with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures random make sure the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used to order the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date still has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have annotated your pictures and videos, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through these images, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, there are entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you typed information when you have submitted your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are shown. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button that is located on the right-hand side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must determine yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you must select the picture-view window (in closer description) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu. in the view window, you can select the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you run the search in the main window, a dialog will show you which is very similar to the setting of the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you want to enter a string in the Labeling or Description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched by this text. if you wish, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be a part of the total file, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can search all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will see pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the fast entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try them.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this paste shows you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed previews from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will only preview images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; gives you two possibilities to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following section of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three fields of content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if you want to create a & kphotoalbum; export file that is visible on the overview page. you can find information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed on the viewer without description. for example, that all pictures are of a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically made.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this way, those who look at your website and own a monitor who supports the maximum resolution 800x600 have no more images download, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so, it can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a smaller transfer time. if it wants to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best of all, choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is stored and next time automatically added. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE-supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages are created will start. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, properly you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings currently described have all been related to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images to be saved in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">"" "in the manual" "" "Manual near the .kim file" "", "you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file." ""</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatically copy & photoalbum copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit picture size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very big. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import..., & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing wizard is made up of four steps. first, you must select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category of persons belonging to the importing file (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) Setting information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently it closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the uppermost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can back up with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; see the folder where your images are stored and automatically use them for future launches. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; you can start with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you will be able to change to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will see the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call the F1 key and click on the option you want by pressing a button.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Sub-categories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of one group at one time in one group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his module system with other graphic applications such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page, which you can invoke via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I hadn't warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are simply a folder. even though & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order for albums, so you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album you have to pass a list of albums, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category people, & kphotoalbum; do so, so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen once you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu bar and toolbar at the top. there is not much information under the toolbar, as you have not added any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each picture with annotations. this includes information about the people depicted on the picture, where the picture has been taken, etc., for example, you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box, in which you can set people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on sliding the images within the list: for example, if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved upwards, to find and assign people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you'd rather want to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting button by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, just click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. furthermore, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window showing the USA as an overview. to show you that this is an over-group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the lath which form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to see this window later again, use the button Options... and then a / out window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the image in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set a filter. for example, you can see the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't open a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the images you want to delete and select either the Delete button or select Edit Select from the Edit menu. now the window will be shown to you in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; that is to use pictures without you saved on your hard drive. of course you have to store the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary pictures can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnail images are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view these images too. you can also not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and copy them back. & kphotoalbum; do not support it until now to ask for the insertion of the concerned CD. so if you want to avoid irritation like the mess of your images, please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu, you will find a submenu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those left you want to make accessible to others and click on Recent View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister can view, control and unlock the menu item Any other than current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set what pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item to lock pictures, which makes all the images you have locked away. if you want to see the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe. on one hand, all images on the hard drive and on the other hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and describe hours over hours with it is of course that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, kphotoalbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the top of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all these options are available right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see the matching entries for this view. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the image up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide shows. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer is using the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can pull in the image and zoom out. you can use the Minus button to zoom into the center of the picture with the Minus button. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the results of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the key button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key button sets the zooms so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel on the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out with the plus and minus keys are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you might prefer to select the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer allows you to provide images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add all of them to your comments. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features may be displayed in the preview view. if you want to display categories in dre Preview, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovray, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully mastered, but the documentation about & Povray; should you necessarily read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are shown in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mode views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, because all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar or from the right mouse button menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can rectify the input errors and then click on the user or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to the & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user documentation already.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera's control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility Level of the higher object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility Level of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovModeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window assignments and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below an existing view, drag the anus to the upper or lower edge of a view. a rectangle then indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the viewer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card holders at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the anus on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left above in the chamfer strip.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the chamfer strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View window setup... save. it will display a dialog in which you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovray; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, it was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovray; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon to render the Rendering icon in the toolbar, or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add any number of Render modes, from a quick preview to full images in the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the tool bar or select Render Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that shows the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination field, you can select the properties that & Povray are used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse retro-reflective lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch off anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling involves the adjacent pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are pursued individually and are checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you switch on jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the Import submenu file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovray; not yet the full range of commands from & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawSupin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray. this adds to the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, just tick the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With Copy and Insert in & kpovModeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovray; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">When you click Help in property view, open & kpovModeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example high field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene directory, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object bycatch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more accurate wire model and thus better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for extended projections, all wiremodel views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the bottom, a floor below the objects is rendered. the bottom is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window assignments or create new window assignments. in the section window settings, it explains how to create and store window assignments.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: shows all available window assignments. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window assignment at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "the" "" "Add window" "" "list shows all available window assignments. a new arrangement can be added with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button" "" "Remove" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be added with the Add button and Delete selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With a new column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating firmly entrenched the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovray; installed and now you want to start without a thorough knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without error, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovModeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera in view has control points that you can change the focus of the camera. just click on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you click the user or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could insert a loader (insert Endable Body Quad) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovModeler; actually offers a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plain in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the plane, although at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scale, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select first sub-object. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the Pigment shows only a matt black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on a header and a bullet in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then go to the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose single-color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step, as you should have understood the basic method of working with & kpovModels; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has moved over the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface looks like a matt black material. in the following step, place a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. like on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First sub-object and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on ball Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces even if metal is not selected at all:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what possibilities you & kpovModeler offers; hopefully you've learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a source of light you see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undone command. you can only select this menu item if you have used the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window assignment and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can modify or add new commands with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands modify or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to chisel each beehle on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuokie; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuokshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can use by clicking the & LMBN; or the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions, mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports Qt and & kde command line options; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script is not executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script whether all the required modules are present and use a kdialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Require 'corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.'</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; which should include any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the default scripts. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now be called & zb; with DCOP functions additional information about the new piece (such as the metadata or the piece length) can be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume indicates a change of volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustommenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected playlist files, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to remove one entry, use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.bz2), which can optionally also be loaded with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the creation amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you're looking for just a certain title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collections browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You might already have some playlists, but can never decide which ones you want to hear? then the playlist browser is exactly the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">As & Amarok; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the mailinglists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you activate this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep up-to-date pieces when changing the piece, the playlists window will open up / roll to keep the piece running always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing a piece of text to the context browser, the context browser automatically displays as soon as the next item is spelled.</seg>

<seg id="1224">The subwindow on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog to select color selections. if the colors are not selected, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering space holders, the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen of a multiple-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers enable further adjustment possibilities in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection, including the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok to search for music as well as their subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring Changes: enables & Amarok to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the drop down box Driver: allows you to choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is needed in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card file last.fm addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by looking at ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection again be created.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because Taglib crashes when reading meta information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is somewhat mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email automatically opens on a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into meta-information, but don't label it as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right portion of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the interface intuitive, the Start subwindow was converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating columns must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column Display. click anywhere in the new review column to specify the review for one piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different ink (e.g. ossiness).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first decode. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper suid is set:</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installing some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make working with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream. directly below is the range, the playing time, bit rate and sampling rate of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the Player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnified window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display you can also find the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used for the Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 preferences, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist by & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist for all players; available multimedia player. it has many features that are not in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">Context Browser shows different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows are later added to the detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow Start is away. the information shown there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok. additionally, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see here, how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded either with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the suggested pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information is to be displayed in the music subwindow. right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the album's content.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in each area to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other websites with the help of self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button searches for google.com search for the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">This is the best view of your collection. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Interpret / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Group album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / performer - your pieces are sorted first by genre and below according to performer.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly beneath the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. hints for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a selection box, which allows you to filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours to one year. furthermore, you can also select your entire collection, which makes the filter virtually shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empower the current playlist and add the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attached to Playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you can reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">As a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">For media players transfer the pieces to the queues for the transfer to the media player. for more details, see the Media Player browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Due to this, the selected pieces are sent to K3b and fired either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into bin bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, mark the selected album as a compilation, prompting it to appear among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Elevate compilation - change an album marked as compilation back into a normal album. after that the album is no longer displayed under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes dealing with many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist. there, you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (eg. iPod); for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod; when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod according to interpreter in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them drop on the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. if the transmission is complete, finish & Amarok; and release disk connectivity for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from a entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press input button, you can access music in the music .tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping down the Shift key. in this case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: thereby dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. in order to reset the filter, press the button again until the text box is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter, for example, one or two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) will be found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then close the search term with griffin feet: Mike Oldfield. this will look for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for bigger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: - something is looking for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key pressed, and then click the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button, where you can add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1478">The contents view also allows you to select and drag files to the project view. the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive was selected in the folder view with a corresponding CD / DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the other views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialog box to change key assignments for & k3b;. once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs, so you need to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is meant for personalizing and for fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">In order to use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and type of task is vital, which of the included programs will give you the preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you must make sure that & k3b is started; then type something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP functions, which all & kde; -program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other features for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () void copyDvd () void copyDvd () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (KURL url) void burndvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bProject ProjectInterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void CreateFolder (QString Name) void CreateFolder (QString Name, QString collision) void addUrl (KURL:: List urls, QString collision) void removeItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio creator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde; with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read out and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many coding files that encodes these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. more encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a precompiled package; if this is not yet installed, it must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step you have to have lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders. all these programs are usually available for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoder / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from the CD; if not the firmware of the CD; / DVD device protection, it is not possible to circumvent the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the notifications (such as Protocols, Piepsen) for program events (like reading the & CD; exit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main Setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different learning flashcards (such as encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied free with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex tracks of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all songs of a song. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hifi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality, regardless of the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched from the freedb via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed and used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to coding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -t of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; must be added. the result looks like: '-t {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters needed (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of yourself into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation: this means the author) bin not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; it is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address as the ones installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when calling the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who reviewed the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; to use freedb set up, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which tool is used to store pieces from the CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more closely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the concerned Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console). this means that 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on and ob both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understand everything, but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine, as it is not considered completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permissions to it (eg; by trying to copy something into the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudio creator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with freedb to download the file; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them by reading one & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is forwarded to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the CD-ROM, and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only In case of incomplete information, please select, so that you will be informed if information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet during the reading of the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD is found; this is associated with low risk, if you are dissatisfied later with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory / filename is changed with konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb is not used. however, this is over 620 MB large, think twice whether this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the freedb section.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally with the server as many firewalls boot the 8880 protocol by default, possibly more luck with the 80 protocol, because the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with just one available drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this for the CD; to eject at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything as shown on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, you may need to leaf a bit to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is around 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in the case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous to encoding wav files: with a dual core or quadricore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encoding more than a WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the CD; on the hard disk runs. we will set up and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is arranged on the hard disk, is set up in the preceding section.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD; which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from those for one & CD; with successfully obtained freedb data. therefore you will learn the & CD; to collect data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, the CD now needs to be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen shot. this only when the CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, consult the section Questions and Answers for help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully collected by the freedb, all tracks are already filled out and the artist's name and album name will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there is a window displayed, and you can select the database entry, which in your opinion fits best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Actual Title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for individual comments as individual, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successfully retrieving data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and to only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least for what & kaudio creator.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help for encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the tapered CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BOM list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the button Select the selection process started, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">"" "click the tab" "" "Apply" "" "to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar." ""</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, readout and encoding occur parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. with high-performance machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & knot;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & k- support. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & kde; each MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window can be drawn to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (lyrics or text events). kmid automatically determines the used procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you are & kde; finish while playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it will display the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also convert a file from a & konqueror; -Window to the & kmid; this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Abplay in the toolbar, select the entry Abplay from the menu item or press the space key.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the & kmid; (in several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & mid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and moving it back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows to the left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song texts, and some other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event styp is automatically determined which one song uses, so you don't have to manually adjust the Karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event styp, select the entries in text messages or lines from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files you summarize. these are played by the series. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find this in the menu item under the item Organize... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the wished in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the sub-menu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is rearranged.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song back, select the button previous piece, select previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not play a role as it is not saved when leaving & mid;</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Trumpet's Change patch to Trumpet events, making a trumpet sound when playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as many times as desired. however, the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap"... END Define keymap "Another keymap"... END Define keymap... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer and support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the principle sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60) which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the concept drum patch the patch is meant, in which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboard players own).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how tones are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as is the presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. see the provided keymap as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name name for this channel is needed. if you use the Keymap option, all events will be ignored, trying to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used for no decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM professes that a keyboard that is a pitch-bender event will play with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need a little bit with & kmid; try going around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of piano creatures (one for each MIDI-channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not shine anymore in green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc; thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, so supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection before. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or plugged (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a file, just change to the & konqueror; -window and drag the file into the & kmid window; drag.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file, without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.O.. first you only want to play the first file. so, set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mide and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, that encourages me to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take some time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or, if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larpink @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrais.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends from & kmid; however, before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get any money from anyone. I would like to point out that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE tickets was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also include Jose Lus Sanchez for testing GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who has sent me a patch, an error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrais.es / ~ rlarge- / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to sites with further karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile and mid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of the formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE web site to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is a window of information that is only displayed when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connection under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the permanent playlist category.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical position. if you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer directory can be edited by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the edit mode is abandoned or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 'N'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; img dur = "in." src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / etc. / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ gt; / lt; / etc.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; can render 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash can be specified in the setup dialog file Zuordnung (KDE).</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the backend edition is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">With that a predefined backend for a specific mime type is taken (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device must be configured and the TV channels need to be configured. in addition, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Quele- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be recognized ports from which one is selected. the encoding used to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config.)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introversion, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vauldron.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints about how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as a user root after connecting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom will show the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does every time my CPU need to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is hold. kxineplayer needs the last saved value automatically, only the first time xine will test the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source editor - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Kile; if you notice larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line to execute the command (e.g.\\ end {instruction}). this function can be set in the settings box; LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into several elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI; file is created, jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the mouse button, the elements of the DVI; file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section in the & latex; source text has been clicked, is injected at the corresponding location in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be" "" "ready to grow" "" "and there is no call from & Okular.After the quick construction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick introduction of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick incorporation of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">"" "the" "" "Select" "" "field is available for articles such as keywords, hints or references. the options available are:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture, or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is shown with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the & bibtex; files can be written in & Kile, of course.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ het e is used for defining the font size. the font size can be specified for the main text, the columns, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ shutters contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use MenÃ ¼ s Building or the Quick Building button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; the storage is automatically deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if it is not the case, it should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging of the document should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest document. for example, a report with font size e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no reduction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, it can be added to certain fonts, fat, cursive printing, submissions, etc. these commands end with the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic pressure and is as long as possible until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {ratio}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is shown to write the source code with the & latex; a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments to the better readability of the document should be performed. to this end, a quote, a few passages in the fat and cursive print and a poem, should be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device-independent file format (D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI file, the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed with file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only modern under Settings box must set up... Build tools.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute pre-set search, the mouse-pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and can be clicked on target search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; - viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and injected to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using Schnellbau (s & DVI) viewers, an error may occur. if there is an error, this will be summarised in the log file or message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file will detect the source code in the source code. in the editor you can use the Previous LaTeX errors and bug reports for jumps between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the flawed line, the error in logging has to be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard is used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file can be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and select file template from document... Create a new template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings Kile... Settings Generally set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ programm class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can then select your own template instead of the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & Posters; as internal editor. & Posters; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & posters.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very handy & latex command reference, which can be called through the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with trl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par from\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source code and highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can add additional jumping marks. this is an own type of bookmarks inside the text. the MenÃ ¼ rÃ ¤t Edit champions or the corresponding keypad allows the jump to the next or last jump-mark. thereby, this jump-mark is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first entering of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; even though it offers excellent possibilities, in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; include always many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">A paragraph is meant to include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this extended meaning closes with tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also has & latex; -commands with a dotted line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course this can be selected first and by pressing the key Del. & Placards; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for a faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to do select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been shown that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {surround}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering multiple nested surrounding commands, quick overview can be lost. this command stops the last opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special orders for the & latex; groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located in front of or behind the sprawling bracket of a & tex; -group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering multiple nested groups-parentheses, quick overview can be lost. this command stops the last group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suit marks are used as a gateway. for the expedient realization is used in & Kile; the sign 'used for two simple reference marks.' & Kile; knows this case and includes two closing quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double landing characters can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX to be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for foreign language settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French add marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; input button for & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, t & Kile closes; the current line with\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be set up under Settings Kile; Set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to make this possible. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the above line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Posters; already offering a good source code completion, it has been added to & Kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;), it has been added to different modes. all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings Kile... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment will begin with the command\\ begin {setting} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {setting} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last letter of the input is removed and the complete list of letters can be reduced. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively from & Kile; you can also add jumping marks, so that a jump to these positions can be possible by editing the jump marks NÃ ¤chest jumping brand and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... box; full-time settings can be made to these lists. there can be various list lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher des generic language-use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call for full-space mode will result in a large list of environmental commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for full-scale operation.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the full-scale operation over the menu item, or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment automatically starts and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient recording can be continued in the simplest way and ending by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & Kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... box; full-time settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of execution mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of collars that are immediately replaced by more expensive strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be set up. as an example of an output list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode has been initiated, the letter L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rter are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the complete registration for all already written orders.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... box can be switched off. here also the threshold value for the display of full-scale termination can be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and rearrangements of pages. if the PDF output is enacted, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the result of the work, the source code needs to be compiled. all the building tools are compiled in groups in the MenÃ ¼ s Generate compile, create changes and create views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for the viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key element Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be converted into a PS file by means of old; 4 the DVI; file can be viewed into one PS file and be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on a flashcard in the Xsldbg dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared.</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list you get a summary information in the dialog box below. if a variable is a specific expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">Contains, then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When clicking a variable in the list, the text-pointer is transferred to the corresponding line of this file in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration in & quantaplus. all these tools use commanders as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as sublage. the combination provides fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Everyone who worked with the & kde; -documentation knows me and how outstanding it is. if we raise it a piece, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; just click on the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is found in the desired working folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; -files will be deleted every time meinproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I said before, anyone who has worked at the & kde; documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for this.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file is index.docbook then just leave the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docBook is found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, your file is flawed. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus; then they are simply checked. if not, they delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of a different file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file well-formed is, click the Well-formed Review selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">For using one & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, they choose & DTD; (External), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the DTD; both for the & W3C; & XML; Schema as well as for the RelaxNG check is the definition of the definition URI; in the file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; has also a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file in & quantaplus has already been selected, you can simply select the current file. if not, remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Enter the name of the file as the result is named. the file is normally stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, which & quantaplus, det, have with & quantaplus, themselves possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not need to wait until someone to use the desired in & quantaplus; the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location used & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a sort of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the statement of team members and they can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and the button Setze as expressed. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file in CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event Configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addsat can be a team or subproject manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Annotation is easy. either the note entry from the editor context menu is selected or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by annotation text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project:</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for script- and formatting languages that is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible through the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... called. this dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion, it can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / Kleincaps are case-sensitive by automatically inserted tags. normal capitalization means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Big / Kleincaps of attributes: uppercase of automatically inserted attribute. normal capitalization means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagging XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, tags, for which the closing day is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Non-optional tags automatically close: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish tag automatically update: when enabled, the corresponding tag is changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting various types of files. restoring default values can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise known as the file opening of opened files (where the encoding of the file can be passed over). however, this setting is stopped by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regularly backup copies so that during a power outage or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view (or documentation in a cartel), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and andocken / dependencies of views. it corresponds to the --resetroot command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hook up of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source-text views in its shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the mapping of parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure tree Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep when changing the structure tree should be automatically opened. empty knots are empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are grouped in groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid PHP group where the ifdump shortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are Ks-applications from third side, which can be re-used by any part-capable application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin, if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the related folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then test & quantaplus, if the inserted information is correct. select also if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the button Options in addition to the Debugger Plugin Selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. appears normally in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that in the normal case it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or ends the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will be continued. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution will continue. if a script is given, the execution will start as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Tells debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there were not the current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered, or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale and this part of documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can and quantaplus, adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus can help you to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; provide support for Markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folders contain handy, symbolic toolbars of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the property dialogue, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document with no risk of a typist.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bearing the name of the descriptive language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the day type. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common-attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag edit dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source of data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that assembles the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be available for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; Declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but be mindful of & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tool dialog is at the top in & quantaplus; -windows to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following, an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag = "overload" type = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for achieving it via DTD processing DTD settings. this allows diedescriptionrc; for a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = vermin 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional).</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set by setting actions... to be created. click New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The selected key shortcut, attached to this action. by clicking on the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or portions of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus, themselves are the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This is how & quanta / scripts / apps / quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced by PGD of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be used by & quantaplus; in the selection field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, run to the default output output. it can be specified, what should be done with the output written to the standard output by setting the value the selector output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in a given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Enter all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphic other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size andern.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, numb, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signaled that clicking on this icon is a & lt; start; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "press the" "" "Apply" "" "button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete." ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview. open the toolbar to set dialog about settings toolbars. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back to the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in root folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062">Loop of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # prior to Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but be mindful of & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the section of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file attachment lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements which should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in various places there is an email send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with Email, send toolbars toolbar with Email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus users can download it. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication. to make a longevity, we recommend using the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your passphrase for your private GPG key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and start clicking OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigate & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is not currently supported by & quantaplus, by creating a DTEP package. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in XML format. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Description: the string that appears in the! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; -editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; adjusted. it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for anyone, who & quantaplus; uses, available. from toolbars about actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are available to everyone in a multiuser environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the project folder tree, which empowers the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the learning boxes with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for more detailed information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the right mouse button to get a context menu matching the current document, such as closing the current, other or all file frontrunners, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarking or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click on the editing pane will lead to another context menu for the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copying / pasting), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the symbol that represents the tag. now you can enter the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The project views (QIT;) enable to navigate, open and strip information in the information to & quantaplus. in the presentation with file operators are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project by right-click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be performed using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripts. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here too. by clicking the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to the navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows changing all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technique for your development to be found. it can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site can be downloaded, and by adding a folder doc to a project can project specific documentation, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two flashbacks at the bottom of the window where useful information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This trailblazer shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; -scripts which are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the way to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed tar archive via & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; allow autoconf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While striving to create the best & HTML; Editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus would be an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why does anyone else develop? thanks to the & kde; scaffold is not only possible but allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables Web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly evolved to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffett Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. each time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"" "when inserting from the clipboard there contain special characters for" "" "& HTML" "", "so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard to & URL; scrub which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">This is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Dismantling and turning the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu after the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with a file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manage the project. in chapter & quantaplus, projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are stored in project toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be saved by settings dialog... added. toolbars are stored on toolbars toolbars or you are asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the loading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be freshened without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a standard submenu in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent pasting means that & quantaplus; inserting using toolbar means that this day is contradicting the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the Posters; -Version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS, or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may need time or unpleasant graphic. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode representing the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a single entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence any application that use the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of posters, one finds details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbars or add them and change row sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse model, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled out best from top to bottom, as after filling out the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except one processes local data. either a name (hostname.exemplary) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the location of the remote machine, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Note that if files that are somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the files you want by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu tree menu in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings are similar to those in the Project Assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvindicates, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plug-in can be set using the Options button. troubleshooting is described in.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow profile upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by pointing an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, modify, or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project open... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project supervision gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is retained in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programing. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unreliable password on the disk do not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files shall be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety-wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply swap the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted in the project or project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar, opened or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus, to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; the best can be stacked by menu toolbars. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is treated at the bottom in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and icons on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions can be removed, toolbars, or toolbars can be executed, which will be displayed in the dialog where you can specify which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, entries will be removed and action worked, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu... and set Settings actions.. Set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates in principle like a usual filesystem with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or merge any directory existing on the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in some the limitations you present for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; delivered templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are normally inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information about the Template Tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. typically, more specialized documents are stored in corresponding subfolders. you do a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment about a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, combined in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook, etc.) and select File As Template Save As a local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged with drag & drop to the constructional view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and dropping or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or project files, you can click on a folder on the right and select Site template to enter and back a name for the template. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can also be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can pre-enter headers and footers, or dynamically use & PHP; create, insert files, or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template view, click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selector with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as the parental attribute has been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set like that, it would disable templates in this path unless explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you will probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows leading or imagined text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with matching headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source text editor, which is accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; -Editor and the second editor divides the editor window into two parts: the source-editor and the VPL; -Editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; -Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor on a document, which & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the VPL / source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the VPL; the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor is activated, this mode is already active, offset the active cursor from a window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The Synchronization gap between the VPL; editor and source text editor is configurable using the Quanta settings.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle, you can adjust the time interval. in principle, the recommendation is: a small gap for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so you can choose document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called upon as soon as a new document with the VPL; -Editor is created. this is useful for the reduction of the manual coding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click on the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column names and keyword keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is exactly as possible with the Meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2224">Cursors are used like in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves curiously. the marking works as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as the tool bar, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags is not removed previously already existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed by any other ambient anchors tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the Table Wizard or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3?? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Merging was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made much work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; when automatically selecting the correct changes. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and refers to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease typing by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 -o destination folder kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 3 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 3 -o destination folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The open dialogue enables manual typing of file names, selecting via the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog reveals your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">If you select a folder, the same or merging folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, but a folder for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">Set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting the same / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison then starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and inserting text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The Info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white marks are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, which separates the abstracts column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are enabled, the line is shown on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The results window (among the comparison windows) also has an info-line with the wording output:, the filename and [gearing] if you edited the result. usually it contains already text by automatically merging text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons below to find the unsolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merging conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting sources ignoring the options or ignoring ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate will mainly be navigated with the screen strips and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side, start, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you can use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the drop window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the Collaboration and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, the next / previous difference (Ctrl-down / Strg-picture Down) or the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you must automatically copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this is checked, whatever you tick is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is not required. however, be careful with this option, as you could accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also do not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences in italic font are displayed. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be displayed straight. on these systems, the button presets automatically creates an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is dispensed with.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-ending type you prefer to save. pre-set value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first, find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white characters may be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a row, while others only store a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return character, but then treated like a white character. while merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. as a result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated in default. changes in comments are treated as changes in white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. check for details on how to compare and merge documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version will be added to the Suffix .orig. if such a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must stop & kdiff3; exit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if this option is checked, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A brief note of the local encoding appears above the boxes for coding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are handled and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting changes in white notes in the text or summary columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a color coded oversight column are displayed. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; gt; C, A & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal, second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window next to each other or overlapped. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as the preset name for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command processor.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\ 1 /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated from $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\ $\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line offset. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Any character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erreset / SCHALTER'However, some details are different with perl. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are maintained for viewing and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorithm provides.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline processor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but like any feature that changes text or hide differences, you may inadvertently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively and merge them together.</seg>

<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to open folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, Folder 1 is used as the basis. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be notified of a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Every file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-click on the object, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened and All subdirectories can be opened with which you can open and fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors A / B / C are used in the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders also have the same color. in folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified, and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merging and storing the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; directly copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsure), then check & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merge, one file is processed one by one. status column shows Fertig when merging was successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is OK everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C will be used as the destination, in the two-folder merge, B will be chosen as destination and for synchronizing A and / or B will be used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also displayed in the folder structure. there are some options by which certain entries could be skipped. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: start / continue directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut) to merge the current element: select the action of the current element, or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Performant, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations if you want to see what would happen without really making any changes. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merging window will open (notice the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you're done with a file, select / continue / continue directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved it yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then continue & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you stumble on a bug, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to resolve the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), let & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later merging of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered as completed.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. there can be several patterns. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignore files, which would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be specified with a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignor.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a preceding dot marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In case of links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equally large. this can be useful for example when copying the changelation date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed to be the knowledge that the other file has not been changed.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only merging whole folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually the folder merge view is visible in the merging of individual files; you can move the window divider to the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the option directory & text window into main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views via switch between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is a corresponding menu entry in the menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to merge the folder together. once you save the result, the status will be saved and the file will not be merged again if you run the folder together.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. KAP3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then there will always be a file as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifying date. therefore, permissions or the modification date depend on the original. (note the option of Confidence of Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally & kdiff3; 2 complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & kdiff3; assumes that the input file is a patch file in the unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then it starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the kepart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There already exist tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now there are compare). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to do it this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3 ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines change next to each other, this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src won; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes under http: / / kdiff3 sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir provides the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems with compiling. if difficulties arise, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Removal) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position respectively replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the update feature after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also causes identical files to merge in the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines are already present), they will be removed when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled in default. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on worktops, change their size, quit or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual desktops as well as the applications running it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu relies on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries pager set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and End. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also moved to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; show the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is displayed along with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are shown as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only empty spaces are displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; the main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN-grid is known, as from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the windows as symbols or with its contents and move it outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and set-up selector dialog... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice versa. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">You can use & Kmag; enlarge a portion of the screen, as if you read a loupe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. the picture shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a moving loupe. alternatively, you can use & Kmag; this causes a selected screen area to be displayed in the magnifying window (drop-down mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-line at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note, that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer into the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key, or the & MMB; use, you can move the dropdown window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the dropdown window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse-cursor holds a while in the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Diseases) and inflict pain on every mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse button freezes for a while on the same spot. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and inflict pain on any mouse click. moreover, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the mouse button is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is carried out. in this way, you can drag the pull with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click will execute.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent relocation is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; once the mouse button is shut down, the mouse button freezes, if no moving is done.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving leads to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; this feature is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouseclick, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may, if necessary, reduce the response times of & kde; in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which areas a mouseclick without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute the mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to create a keyboard. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can deal with it. it is very likely to highlight text, copy it into the clipboard and re-insert it or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; select text instead: drag one click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and re-click the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will trigger each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when you move the smart move the delay time begins. later, you can use the intelligent slide without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to be able to use kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and a loudspeaker, and they are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; right-click as soon as the mouse cursor is in a nutshell. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male), since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the issue of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival Configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs do not divide text into single phrases. this allows you to start or stop jobs faster with reading, since only the first movement must be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit detection filter is set up automatically as a default. you can modify its settings or add further propositions recognition filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker selector by sample. turn on the selection of speakers and select text to read. switch on the selection menu again, change some features and check how the speaker's selection is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then proceed faster with reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can stop or cancel text orders on the map menu, even if the speech synthesizer doesn't support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal movement recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Statute recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for propositorials and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulator characters are removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set detection filter retains the character set-up.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (bother), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set detection filter by mistake, you can re-paste it by reloading the contained file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the topmost on the card speaker). in other words, no speech characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a subscriber. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; select the speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the original set of speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the speaker's properties here. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property has priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker section, which is best to delete the following, click on the standard speaker toolbar and then use the speaker that is best suited to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and ktts; you will probably need to register GStreamer. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, it may be a non compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I hold a text order, freeze and ktts; one. on the console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is a problem that conflicts occur with ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find clues for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr shows not this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program needs to be installed as x and can be discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermodule such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -to-SSML reshaping filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & ktts; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-Tags after Saber the GENDER-tags. the same applies to the VOICE-tags too.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own character replacement filter and now I can in & ktts; no longer precede or return. on the back of the box, orders are displayed, the order only consists of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question marks, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out. instead, use a filter for the propositional recognition instead.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module will display network settings in & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed while installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to select from the list that best matches the distribution and releasestand. by selecting the setting No-again requests the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of network settings this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system administrator mode. before, all options are gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system administrator mode, you can enter system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administrator mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box to be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed with the start of system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP server can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The choice Manuell can configure the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask, the subnetmask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching on a switched-out network device is selected by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the machine in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communications with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution machine part of the name resolution allows for easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be placed in priority by selecting a single entry or downgrading or downgrading in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named above describes hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some well known machines, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add New alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the well known machine has multiple alias names, press de button Add several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of an especially known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog to edit your computer will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, it is sufficient to install Qt and & kde; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of & knetworksheets; change configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed to a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found a wide spread. IPv6 is expected to get through in the near future, so this description is currently focused on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is to be assigned to a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; the network administrator is the contact point that has a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are mostly used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0128; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own host).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This part contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically modified for DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is handled by the scripts in SuSE. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& dat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first one was to create a tar surface that provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective delivery. the second purpose was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be included in & dat file; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; recovers the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & dat; don't recognise the default on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat file; the default, searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape was resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & dat; it must be formatted by & dat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape format must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat file. if your tape drive is formatted before use, this must be done before you can be formatted by the tape. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, whereas DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, the band continues with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape are lost. after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you launch the backup procedure, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files listed in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up Settings for backup. in this dialog, you can again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will display backup. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select menu entry....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the settings for verification, the dialog appears to Verify. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog will display settings for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog appears restore. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the band indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types from the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the knobs files & gt; & lt; lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-unwinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat file; before the tape is included, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & dat file; to lock the ejection of the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the band will automatically disconnect & dat file; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option for floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & dat file; the hardwaresfull block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must communicate & dat file; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat file; a tape format, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">The format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar-archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this icon is only active when a tape is included.</seg>

<seg id="2941">& kSystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & kSystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kSystemlog enables experienced users to access, for example, information about problems that occur on their server. & kSystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, see & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching, and kSystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open the system log. if you don't see it, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not to have system administrator rights. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read under Linux.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or after entered string. in addition, enter a string in the filter bar. in the default setting, the selector contains next to the filter the entry All. then a protocol line is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filtering bar, so show you and ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye-catching color than protocol lines of the level hint. the colored display of protocol lines can be turned off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to view a particular process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use the filtering bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add-to-line option in the main window context menu to display all new rows in the next rows.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& kSystemlog; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program start-up of the system in the & Linux world. and that is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to boot when you run the system or change to a different runlevel. system services don't include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls are rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something at boot, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel tries init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could have a user runlevel, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runleveling or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you remove an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target zone -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry may sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tabulator key to enable the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with clipping into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. include the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are recovered by & ksysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Specify the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplify the configuration for the proprietary programming of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or set up incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. either, use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a flashcard is created where you can set individual settings. more flashcards appear if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears if shadow passwords or / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This file only appears, if for at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable from the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here parameters may be changed for each user, with the space constraints contained in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the array file system with space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform you about the group affiliation of the selected user. the standard group to which the user is heard can be found in the Primeric group field. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, highlight this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove, and change the boot password, change the time to the booting of the default operating system, add, remove, add, add, add, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
