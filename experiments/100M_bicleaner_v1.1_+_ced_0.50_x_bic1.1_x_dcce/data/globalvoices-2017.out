although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I &apos;ve danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were prone to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely after Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal letter of love about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp arrived .
much has been written about the xen@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can elections was the highest number ever achieved by the party nom@@ inate candidate .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and its voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
then there were Andrew Tast@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp appe@@ aled to his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over the presi@@ dency of a man , despite - or perhaps due to his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
ordering people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translation of the White against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , as it called the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world value the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the choice of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , a vast majority of the white America promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a wor@@ ding with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp would have been my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Khan spoke with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t this your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for whom his son had fallen , sent him a message .
that &apos;s now Tru@@ mp &apos;s land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America anymore .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music destroy by tr@@ ash
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user O@@ EA @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what does the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gang violence .
but this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare chance of hope .
the young band members take their commitments seriously to the music group , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shining eyes and play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music out of tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ structured instruments made from local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er started turning parts of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all made of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing before it opened the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u recalls , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which inter@@ sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries stop ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries , who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other wherever it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legally Fishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing from regions .
by the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail speed , which circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also very atten@@ tively tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . also , such susp@@ icious routes can be discovered - such as those pointing out that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and , if necessary , whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay fin@@ es , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about substantial financial losses to the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $ 20 million lost in lost revenue which will lose the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries that attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , indication of fiction , fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we purpos@@ efully exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has participated in more than 30 investigations of susp@@ icious vessels .
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several dec@@ eit@@ ful identi@@ ties and it has followed and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious vessels more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information together . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Sea protection organization : a platform that provides satellite data and enables the position of every tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that formerly were fishing without licence and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y turnover , since fishing boats purchased more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia , the inspec@@ tors found on board tow@@ ing nets whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries joined the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country in Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets , which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also entered into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans really works across the ocean .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the government , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , including in the plains of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest on the whole world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , called for the trial of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

on Twitter pictures which talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the central north @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safe again , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already accounts for the level of repression per day :
so the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an official authorisation procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street .

others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , made little effort against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and preferred to con@@ fer critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of CÃ³rdoba .
as the meanwhile grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano , as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba , said against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investigated the crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that this was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer , and a mur@@ derer .
Luis was not a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was the gendar@@ me . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 until 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department at La Per@@ la prison until 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended you with one of the ERP .
just make sure they don &apos;t run you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ In@@ side the prisoners are tortured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a big ch@@ unk of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked inside and saw a couch that people were tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there .
they seldom tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty j@@ owl .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to do so much suffering to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied up at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people cau@@ tioned quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my dad told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to information from survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , runs through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way in which the kidn@@ apped people came here .
if you look at the map you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be moved .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; Battle of the Battle &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen stuff .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it was called - was .
but when I was in the army later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war people are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military bad@@ ges , that you take away from an enemy you have fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , record player , clothing , painting , money ... then that is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and will kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my dad was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar @-@ pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ red act &apos;
now , when I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kidn@@ ap children ?
one day my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tortured , but why were they killed ?
you could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it &apos;s just decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families , to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act that man can do .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ inst@@ ated , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they claimed were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I saw the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me for being pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error to a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Japanese city , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , witnessed a very un@@ fortunate translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the false translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a native of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n newspaper , appearing in K@@ YO@@ TO , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous English translation was removed first . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists , who are involved nationwide in accidents , is quite an occasion for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens prov@@ oked 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 incidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents in total has fallen , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the particularly un@@ named re@@ porter brought comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ w against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awesome car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So that the translation is incorrect , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a true translation error &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the belief that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confusing and enig@@ matic phrases that arise by machine translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this applies particularly to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them the enig@@ matic prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : watching protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
home of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) by the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV was also no longer accessible .
other online channels took over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ an people with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant in reporting against protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it &apos;s amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ GA fil@@ lies later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses to respond when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into prison .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an an increasingly difficult access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ ti@@ ta as a child . she now visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other cri@@ tiz@@ ens who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report from Kur@@ ent , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ ela que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ liegende cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has become of something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ ti@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money over@@ spends her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ k@@ Delta generally guarantees silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra crashed into Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they emphasized that the murdered child was a cri@@ cket .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the girl &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows are registered as children in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ k@@ ta .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes before court .
the Every@@ day Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the cri@@ tiz@@ ens are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all work and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got more books from the house &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was part of the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he considered it smart , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would return home her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .

bill dict@@ ates social media to Egyptian users to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliamentary dep@@ uties voted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulate the regulation of use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months , with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill , composed of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs across the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration . it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register given the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Pro@@ mot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunic@@ ation ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of these , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Technologi@@ sts ( in German speaking research techn@@ ologist ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , spoke Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control forci@@ bly physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously then it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislature and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament where control is maxim@@ ised and that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , MP T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber @-@ crimin@@ ality where a life sentence for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; appe@@ aled to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian Leop@@ ard in the Iraq war

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team finds in the video that they have a picture of a large cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of another side of her country , which is not just war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and Nature Iraq &apos;s educational programs for six years .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who suffered from the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of Japan &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbor Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map .
in addition , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has had a nuclear accident , because of this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which advances have been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market . key Vend@@ ors â¢ This report provides you with a breakdown of market value by type of construction activity ( new construction , repair and maintenance , refurbishment and demo@@ lition ) .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that until December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( for example , a cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) can be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , who , after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , was reloc@@ ated to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 1,@@ 100 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by the disaster have re@@ opened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered wholesale destruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of farm@@ land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma continues to be far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feelings had changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the indigenous population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
as it is for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience .
from 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent spare @-@ houses .
according to the current state of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation stations are older than 50 years old . it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be larger at first than the similarities .
after a while , however , one often sees that it connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives , and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone across language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ mm@@ man explains how the love for music prevailed during a trip in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police at nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student aged 33 years was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a head@@ stock during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that until the end of the investigation , S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests to the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and hur@@ ries several plum@@ bing shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attended the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a head@@ stock .
police Rev@@ en@@ ues Collector &apos;s Edition
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where brutal police attacks against demonstr@@ ators last Friday came .
police officers were seated at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ eful Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have ret@@ ou@@ ched the street protests by turning the focus on another unexpected protag@@ onist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to make a photo of their front pages illustr@@ atively .
O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a fire set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are tu@@ cked up by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by de @-@ industri@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
the sugar cane industry was still standing still in the region , and the factory lost its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves anew .
some changed the job .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uted daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are back in operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and barely competitive they became unbe@@ arable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of altogether 98 sugar cane factories , over 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened at the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about closing the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it dealt with officially written documents , which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the employment and services generated by the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted highly by milling .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to quote them , they ceased to asp@@ ire to asp@@ ire the street , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they have become spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region once again .
in the area a food factory was created whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies they told him .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene is 65 years old in retirement , not because he lacks strength , but because he is ban@@ ished .

the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group The Nor@@ th@@ Star .
the workshop brings with it that the young participants discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protag@@ onists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalisation is .
many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always control the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ hor@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day you will lose our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and promote our youth as well .
this is how they can do what they have ordained for the Creator .
in the comments section , the reader and defender of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the graf@@ ting to Sil@@ verb@@ ade ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , near the entrance , sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by any dish served in this restaurant .
the customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ metrop@@ olitan area of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new coated phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been converted to kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ic@@ ura or nit@@ rous oxide is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody that would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon .
you can view other bizarre plastic dishes at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which is a very nice one .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , such as the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug trade &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and those killed regularly appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings .
reporting on drugs such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug trade &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were caught in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changes life &quot; ) tells just these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them , because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get those ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the draft .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal for people to hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ under &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and are silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pil@@ la@@ ged with threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals had black@@ ma@@ iled money from their business for month until they had torn apart the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are removed , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested for they don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence recorded by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor called 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , which aims to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand im@@ pi@@ tious words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something appeared the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its initial release , it has been used irre@@ fut@@ ably to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false combination of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meti@@ culous reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim .
officials described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses envel@@ oped , including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the soccer world championship .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to be un@@ recognizable .
a picture with the title &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years the same photo has been viewed several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and in@@ correctly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes .
there were reports in which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only by satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but Bag@@ a &apos;s army base was a permanent conflict of conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo again appeared when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments , such as this example , wrong@@ ly link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report published by the United Nations those who escaped could be beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following one reported that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which in 2012 wrong@@ ly claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that AF@@ P referred to as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein that statement , but had not related to the image of the DR Congo .
the world &apos;s range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings extend back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications , and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , some have tried to un@@ mask for@@ geri@@ es .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of what they had been published on which page they were published .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also connected ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use can be found .
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country studies of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to prove counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quoted as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ votes based on the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am as this here , which used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ be@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of theology ( Mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter supporting Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this news to his site to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the DR Congo photo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in Kan@@ o in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand trying to legi@@ timi@@ ze the asser@@ tions , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , since the photos were ab@@ used ab@@ u@@ tively .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Myanmar government published a resolution on what they deemed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which was exclusively published in English , also includes references to bog@@ us pictures of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; catch @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted into 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture will still be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , Kath@@ olische squar@@ ely related news site An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , sleeping the world ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo appeared , fitted with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and spark@@ ed a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater al@@ ert@@ ness in these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am ( and saved more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message , allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos , &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , they translated discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves from the message contained in the DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the spi@@ der and some of them have image data in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two powerful themes or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zed readers and viewers and have the ability to emp@@ ower emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any investigation of wrong attri@@ butions should also take into account how international it can be .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages &quot; &quot; &quot;

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. uns@@ ett@@ able ) makes every effort to provide language fans with a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi Arabian ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ born every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages .
the blog contains , for example , words from the VAT @-@ sla@@ p language from Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ ow to your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting war@@ med up in the sun in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite tracks here .

how Sri Lanka does its worst flooding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon that normally begins at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement from the Sri Lanka disaster centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud floods .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 30@@ 4 safe resi@@ dences .
the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water boo@@ ths of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da in G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a , which occurred yesterday .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various organizations and startups have also decided to help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ja and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 07@@ 77@@ 4@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ entr@@ e is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for the collection of aid services and donations . these were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the combined efforts of the government and civil population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring people in need of security and assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March , January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter , she confi@@ deth her children to me : she is my rock in the br@@ ink .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the next , we are chann@@ eling rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied from an American flag , other chann@@ eling slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same straight away .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit into , will be Muslim .
to become more relaxed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most often sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the Western imagination , Rum@@ i &apos;s religion was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another one exists in the reduction of images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing imagery is determined by the dark man who should be feared and the exotic woman who was to be saved .
in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ sec@@ ted the story behind these images .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ rate them .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , faulty narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US in 2016 could not even choose their first female Pres@@ idential candidate .
this narrative is failing to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ ration weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were killed here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has possessed our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create a narrative that will help us understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ abul@@ ously failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed because seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh called Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unden@@ i@@ able Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an irre@@ ver@@ sible Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of fet@@ ching out my musli@@ m recipes or carrying out my hand@@ some pocket or@@ am , which all Muslims wear with them - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m kid@@ ding , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also not be a theological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for extra security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current tape of a well lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information that is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head scar@@ f .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam hos@@ tility in its ugly forms attacks our belonging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it interfer@@ es with our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims , if they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms , and she whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection , which seals the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

use approved .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters , as she won a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the image of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , the painted Su@@ fi Holy One ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that has been colon@@ ised by a &quot; empire &quot; for centuries , which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia Company , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an irre@@ ver@@ sible for his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging must know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at playing risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all except four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir@@ ic sub @-@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled into more parts of the world than I have ever been and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy makes the US home and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple spreads , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam hos@@ tility is made up in Muslim registri@@ es that started under President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders on people from just the countries they are bombar@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is largely targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we throw off Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Have To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have advised too deeply to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous forms of expression that we are ste@@ aling in our news editors .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry which tries to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they are dominating large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me a miss@@ abi@@ tious Muslim today .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged , and people who have been immersed in public perception four decades ago , was even more scientific to Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of rein@@ forcing the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I put in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no President , the chocolate cake , while already broken lands and &quot; other man @-@ made &quot; people are bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ett@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the creators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure rooms where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feeling , creating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story @-@ t@@ eller , their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to concentrate on it .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotion , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rabbit and the bab@@ o@@ at in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his fork , John Ny@@ am@@ ini@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls for new establishment of state debt from the US
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started with the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ a Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ ural Testing of Deb@@ t ) and the Economic Church Convention Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of debt re@@ constitution also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demanded that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts must be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our reti@@ re@@ es will not settle down with declining pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the state alliance of the US - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , focuses on socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will run without the citizens &apos; participation and conviction to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , was dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist in France resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the Intro@@ duction , it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introductory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of periodi@@ cally extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , its place of residence and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project called Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pres@@ ci@@ ent than the work which he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to eman@@ cip@@ ate this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bass@@ el brought me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is happening at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the pris@@ ms of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with passion ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly turn back to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
during the course of
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ el &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime in 2011 , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : head of corruption sentenced director after release at previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ vo@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ endants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the Mozambique Air@@ ports , whose advice was given by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ setting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which denied the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not finish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the firm should have directed a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
however , the company apparently kept silent and did not take reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been lowered .
he could keep paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young musli@@ m and student of political science in Brazil says , the director doesn &apos;t have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served himself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is imprisoned :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison not only to be remembered as the first independent President , but also as a keen , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous oral representations was , when he energe@@ tically affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambitions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes the tactics but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambitions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and freed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ aghetti . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; et al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use have been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same character sequence as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spac@@ er ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ds believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it sol@@ ves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ tor@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the words next to it .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat has proven that cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from publishing , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example asking the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
it seems as though they have started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely solved posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t contain any hate speech , but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also inc@@ ur violence in Myanmar &apos;s communities , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to bring out the bul@@ ging hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better to look at the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the pa@@ edi@@ atric nurse is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law b@@ anning this practice , so that the age of marri@@ ages is now 18 .
before this change of the marriage law , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities held firm in practice , and in May 2016 there was a large public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , because that is , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were already married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 of 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws to pa@@ edi@@ atric de@@ posit@@ ors followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the child before they should , dar@@ n &apos;t take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition took care of tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and at some point doub@@ ted whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general .
yet at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against chil@@ dr@@ ens was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including one woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which has once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against chil@@ dr@@ ens was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it .
once it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws to pa@@ edi@@ atric had finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of the ministry of education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk to disgu@@ ise the core of the thing , but do you know what ? the pa@@ edi@@ atric nurse is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of adopting the law , noted :
the marri@@ age@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment to the marriage law was approved today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 dep@@ uties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all dep@@ uties , who were acc@@ using , voted for the law .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ hoods turn@@ key .
many thanks to all activists who fought for him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , should the law be adopted and he seems to have his promise to be released .
during the General Pro@@ cur@@ ator Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it is quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wants to act against the law , most social media users desired to approach the debate on the topic differently .
Patricia High@@ sh@@ ole suggested :
better sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion as general , in a way that can only cause panic and anger if we , instead of talking of the problem that the state , our daughters would protect them , that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

screen print of the message posted early on Sunday &apos;s website of the Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lavl district office .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the buffer it remained intact .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has barri@@ c@@ aded the popular and popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of Wikipedia as a crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use encryption tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary file system ) , when the platform ab@@ ased all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names , making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after hearing the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ p@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported sub @-@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and staff at Mozilla &apos;s Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une an animal world onto the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ ro ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a phone call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz@@ ler appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he gaz@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and most of the time he lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ prosecutor and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a pseudo @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married relatives with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ning for the mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands in their name .
she has decided on this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
speaking out of the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they have to maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered to be dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
R@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in his luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion underway with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ys from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women are never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ g@@ gled in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
even in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during the dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reported how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ci@@ amber point on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed only , and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the deb@@ ating club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every stage of discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who they could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are connected to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion group , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ami @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of cur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ lock ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini make sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first stage of discussions , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
so far , we have only made small steps so far .
some women tested it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including myself , make it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realise that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter fashion , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is seen as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who interviewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Day of Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce in Japan . at the age of 51 , they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be quir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market transfer , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will proceed .
so , we hope you are there !

men of bald men are deported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that men &apos;s men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government has now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ ange district , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there was the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man @-@ headed man could hold gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia reported to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
respect for k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably dis@@ believers rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans . this attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bet@@ tering ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches gener@@ ere .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha posted on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger arms Sn@@ ai@@ ah , which indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ W@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country where people would have shame to challenge sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation where people would be ashamed , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald chairs would be hun@@ ted that aim to get to a quick fortune .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ r@@ ene humour .
Zen@@ aida G@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesman Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made just recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his attorney had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) after taking part in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokesman said he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokesman , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to conduct a treatment abroad .
Norway for Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the import of salmon to China as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she said in an statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; him to have the possibility to treat abroad so that he could help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy requested the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the U.S. Embassy filed an angry response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told me that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election to which they claim to be in accordance with the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can get into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported Reuters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada Guide to Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u Ms. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u was not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those rights for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and the United Kingdom
on 29 June , the French Foreign Ministry asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information about whether France will ultimately record it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
on June 27 , China urged China to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance for those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
Tai@@ wan@@ ese leg@@ is@@ lators Yu @-@ M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem foolish because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very clear : he defended an idea , according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re pop@@ s up from the author@@ itarian rulers who are preten@@ ding to be demo@@ crats , aband@@ oning the twisted logic , since it is better suited to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged such questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the inscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation , who makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - either I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review sheds light on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam commit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian angel ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , but do not defend their city , but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister have to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always was a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we &apos;ve always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest install@@ ment of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
the standard answer follows my clari@@ fication : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that separates us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in respect of ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind switching to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , being referred to as &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ ie - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada really was a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major achievement of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau went on stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ano@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has published a music video that has par@@ o@@ ded the jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells you which dict@@ ates his girlfriend does .
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 list@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that have per@@ sist in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making about important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting change &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army , supervised by online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a strict protection against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Great Dan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that buying unnecessary and a waste of tax subsidies is .
in the video it is even shown how people are dump@@ ed into a black van before bringing it into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences if they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song became members of the band , who im@@ itated Sal@@ ut from &quot; Die Tri@@ bute von Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society slowly reco@@ vers in east @-@ west Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ den@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , and today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the area amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey building blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were communal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , which were all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ es@@ ka , which still host one or two families , is recognized by the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a ruined house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de that we are allowed to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to get around the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman moved with the name Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off to Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ational partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once stood , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war once were . &quot;
as our conversation tends to end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball rolling .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood which are responsible for ir@@ regul@@ arity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 .
on the way to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican singer , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , says Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them medications , which they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chy Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ ghurt beard ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao is travelling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when she went on to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests helped her to prepare chickens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
on the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula are from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the passages , the travellers calm@@ ly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy to have her house full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly poses it to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also used the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the min@@ ors &apos; filter aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often ble@@ ak for those living in remote , oppressed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often associate extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which was based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police officers random@@ ly checked out if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by The rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which shows that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council , to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard disks , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ qui &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those involving peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activist , Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane , describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you are looking at yourself and real@@ ising that you are all alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters transform into essence of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts van@@ ish in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents and before them your grand@@ parents , stone and stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not set high demands on a city that is cr@@ ammed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little qui@@ eter after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my house &apos;s roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find them together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a gorgeous image that ful@@ fills my expectations .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to shout when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are tru@@ sting what to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure that I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement and his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in the nose to me today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I had suspended months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I give myself all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell and I resor@@ ted to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : beating the wall with the fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ mate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I am staying .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these cro@@ ws , which are lab@@ elled on the fruit in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al ex@@ cre@@ ment card and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I looked at the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seemed to me like this .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ailed to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;m used to not responding .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and put@@ ts have become an everyday means of communication for me .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or bad to be punished , even though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
in punishment , in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aking .
your exec@@ ution@@ er suddenly stops at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you cannot hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector earlier or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling down and did not take pleasure in doing so , which is why he picked up an electri@@ cally charged staff .
electricity ran through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my half naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
what one can rely on however is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips de@@ fle@@ cted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activist , opposing the conservative majority and questioning their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years of age , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people under the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee from the second generation &quot; - he calls himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he sha@@ kes Nes@@ cafÃ© in water into two cups . it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ adan .
apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot jun@@ cture has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking , the lu@@ gs of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the che@@ eks of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
at times , Jordan is like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look in the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Interior submitted an appearance to the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert tab@@ oo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dep@@ uties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also affir@@ m that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which asks the old @-@ time legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; which continues to &quot; advocate &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply rhetor@@ ic , but actually reflects an increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional sex marri@@ ages by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who had pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tram@@ pled unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
in recent years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; honor mor@@ es &quot; - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tiz@@ ens reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 fr@@ enz@@ y law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have been fool@@ ed by politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in Gh@@ are@@ eb the focus is on poverty again .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ genei@@ ty or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn out of context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a mach@@ ined version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the 8th century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not be able to do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service held several former dep@@ uties and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they had critical comments in social media about the problems related to corruption in the country deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs believes that only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and basic openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster mun@@ itions and artificial kind of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently also resist .
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis reporting , which A@@ man belongs to as a student Fel@@ low .
in A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro G@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro G@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two flo@@ ats are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high fixed car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely , outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road rob@@ bery and illegal drug trafficking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the quir@@ ks of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair styles .
the unparalleled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the Fris@@ eure &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ ser arts instead of bad advice that enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : letters of love to guer@@ rilla fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ rilla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve has published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to meet people who feel expelled , to meet affection ?
the two young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation inspired her to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la Cal@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces of Colombia ) , which is the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in front of the Colum@@ bian people there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guer@@ rilla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhetor@@ ic and were carrying arms around the clock , have now to integrate themselves into life as a civilian .
the Colom@@ bian society , on the other hand , who had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter - who are then to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those they need much more unnecessary .
he plans to share his love with people in this year , who needed most pressing attention .
the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never imagined someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC were as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ rilla fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I looked into one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage where the guer@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gren@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless I addressed him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran to tears for the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gr@@ en@@ ades .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and he wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I just learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
to the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as a war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice in the part of the state turned to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hate me , are just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the land lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colum@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

this follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ab@@ ova and his first publication on the website of the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the coverage of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat that hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community there has not been created overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with kidn@@ apping , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she sheds light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured qu@@ eer qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the sexual equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she eventually moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer at a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents went through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just about to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had everything in their hands and started crying .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two st@@ ings in my right lung .
OC Media : in which pedi@@ cur@@ es were you placed - in those of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknow@@ ns .
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by going up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in Gro@@ z@@ ny on official television , saying that I hadn &apos;t changed my sex that all was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people spoke to my mother once on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a religious woman , but you have to van@@ ish from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
thank@@ fully the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering me , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ gged the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are . they even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equ@@ ation , it &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian items inside me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with a camera , I really try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have been dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ram@@ adan , but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said that there were not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there to present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and say they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown be@@ ards .
since then there has been nothing new about them .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ sn@@ y when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was applied I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore Tub@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Defence of Sh@@ aria has never bowed to my head .
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t laugh at the cal@@ am@@ ity of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when people make fun of the sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never driven and never beaten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ating steadily .
OC Media : what action are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as an active activist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have discovered these people myself when I ap@@ ap@@ per@@ ated refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to make you white with foam before your mouth , that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ age@@ stan@@ ers have what , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is uncomfortable for me to hear such things .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of the identity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to do this personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide bom@@ b@@ ings within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August caused the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video filmed on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide which occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the basis of persecution by the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe job .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made big efforts in 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy all over Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime does not systematically refuse the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , which diver@@ ge water from the Arabic territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dro@@ ught , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youngsters rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide amongst young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not recru@@ iting Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance by young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to bear , human rights activists warn of alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ iel and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black women , on black women in the LGB@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists have to remain silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord , &quot; in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of racial @-@ motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often are referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is standing , who refuses to take account of injusti@@ ces in her mind , which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women forever and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I no woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of bl@@ ending skin colour and sex , because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement tot@@ ality , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for a better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( for example : Afrika @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the spiritual elements can be worshipped , that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are instantly calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither passing , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan Region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - who uses and works to protect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for EN@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed congregations who can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s kill@@ ings in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Kur@@ ent . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ta@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the people concerned .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could undertake nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
as another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for ill treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not make any use of the detailed advertisement of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women give notice at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must notify the law enforcement authorities at all .
contents 1 Stri@@ ke and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that prevents anything from ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays statutes : good approach , impro@@ per implementation strokes and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues in the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements went to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office for domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of police ads came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this because of physical abuse occur to every woman who does not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days in Paraguay , a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this should always regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable :
I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhetor@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for such a long time from Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some blame on them .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ as &apos;s case everything started with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without any result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays statutes : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Women &apos;s Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ici@@ dal to declare a stand @-@ alone crime and punish tough@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the text has been changed in some respects to also attract members of the law who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punished for up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill fores@@ aw most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that must be borne by the victims of violence at present , if they simply place an indication and want to receive a safe accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ate themselves and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators are gone ast@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must allow such a long ad until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim once more .
the cancellation of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after ban of a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Alban@@ ian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court , but were released later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 who came to power after sett@@ ling his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the sul@@ tan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , notably domestic intelligence , public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ain@@ ing human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically limit human rights peaceful and legitimate activities and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent magazine reported since its establishment in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , stated that an article was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties binding hands of justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties involve the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Editorial Board , was invited to the Special Department from the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS assumed the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information warned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any road , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a public ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ans ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year ban on employment was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a security deposit of $ 5,000 was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
al @-@ Abr@@ i acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but condemned Al @-@ Ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari for six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was fired on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he will serve his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to return , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was prolonged by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
further injuries include , for example , closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j the impression arises that the authorities still are not ready to end the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Mexican authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and surrounding states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , mapping takes place with his approval
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the global healthcare market .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ b health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the S@@ Ã¡@@ b national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the receiver instead of being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where does the financing and support come from ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
tran@@ scrip@@ tion@@ ist home based phi@@ li@@ pp@@ ines 2 . September 2015 p@@ Ã¥ 20 : 06 Hi , of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blo@@ gging . thanks .
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
there is need for special academic training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers are changing global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
since the 1980s , Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ able Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t use it for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green@@ ton or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ ons . due to these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton continues to breed salads , but it needs longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a b@@ oul@@ der , around which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breed tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , nobody can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement growing in the USA and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and d@@ ined red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately disc@@ ard - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark outlook
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Executive Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultiv@@ ating seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , the latest examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant features .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking because of the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore becoming available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out about one @-@ third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have deliberately desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for gro@@ wers takes more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and co @-@ operation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the company advoc@@ ates the preservation of genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property uses other breeders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the battle .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in Oregon and Os@@ si , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures whose cultivation requires mass her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , cultiv@@ ates in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , make it the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue because I know that my opponents will sell my varieties myself in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which in my opinion is quite simple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global resonance &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the USA seems to be leaders in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding program , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties fulfilling certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding distinguish themselves from country to country , therefore the Os@@ si commitment cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European Patent Office which patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide Alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be expected next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context , by the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si , hopes that more people will soon recognise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities lock up content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ ides in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ tion of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law to continue to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to reproduce .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of flood barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of Canada &apos;s blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what this meant for him :
the one to lock blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ wa al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ mons from the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice refers to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is additionally worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which it can proceed against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the people argue .

day after day , newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b Phar@@ macy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ se sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air @-@ sea @-@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; published on 16 August , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . , but what happens to the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we , as journalists , do not hide our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , if it is distorted , can also be used to hide the atro@@ cities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is , according to her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accoun@@ table to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio herself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglec@@ ting of the public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , says : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date information available .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per state , Rio is on number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police fire and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for several years , however , the U@@ PP has increasingly been bombar@@ ded with bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ane and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for human beings .
this demands the state to use means and means that are typical of a war . this includes penet@@ rating into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an obsc@@ ure point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police ra@@ cked up the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident inc@@ ited head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the Syria Institute research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a Region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attacked the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition continue on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the need for locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled food by tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional foods that are planted in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant it in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for the past three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining promin@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this Article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , September 4th 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the shortage of fuel locally produced fuel from plastic is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fungi from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they were suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they then planted a small mushroom farm in a basin . as this was possible , they used a larger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the siege of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on 21 October , demanding justice for the victims of fires that were ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16 . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone , roughly 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread across the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better prevention and fire measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people asked why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as much as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers in Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads enclosed by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits are questioned in places with high fire risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wide @-@ reaching draft reform proposal introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was rejected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that permitted building activity if the applicant had the means to self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor allowing everything to be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article to the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread farther and farther , like in a vi@@ cious circle .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Portuguese Civil Defence website on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so decisive in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website numbered more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ habi in Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protective .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on .
there was no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we do not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high response rates . however , it is also true that the conditions found in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Human Rights Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his innocent lives helped A@@ shar@@ af to free himself from these conditions .
after having worked several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af saved his entire savings in establishing a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria of Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and return to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily , if I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their nuts on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are standing .
A@@ shar@@ af himself has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : dra@@ fts from Egypt allow for shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , detained for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearing of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
users should register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or a compensation of a punishment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member of the Parliament reached a proposal where tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or senior officials would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , it may be sentenced to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like over 700 prot@@ esters arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the accused out of prison to the court room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan men@@ tions the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , the charges of fire , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza issued the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ cep@@ ted to un@@ brid@@ led documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was princip@@ ally inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of legislation to grant business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption alleg@@ ations of am@@ nesty , provided that they return all un@@ law@@ fully received mon@@ ies .
this document , published on the Na@@ wa@@ in website on 21 April , sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating articles 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May .
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to impose these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship occupied Russia with access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the provincial government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and force it on request for the cancellation of user data .
these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ ctu@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications declared that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to am@@ end a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week , the UK government finds itself in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor &apos; programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telec@@ om operators and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation still runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
