<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I've danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were prone to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely after Method Man," "" "I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical letter of love about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump arrived.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican elections was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominate candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and its voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps's Weltanschauung did not agree with the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Tastey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump appealed to his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Ordering people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commented on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(translation of the White against all other ethnicities;" "" "white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means" "" "whiplash" "" "), as it called the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world value the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, a vast majority of the white America promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a wording with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "do Latinos have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vociferous" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr Khan spoke with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't this your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for whom his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's now Trump's land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America anymore.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero municipality in Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare chance of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments seriously to the music group, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shining eyes and play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music out of trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguays capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with restructured instruments made from local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler started turning parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chavez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all made of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring drama of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing before it opened the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and slightly inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "all of a sudden the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu recalls, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which intersects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries, who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other wherever it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegally Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing from regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail speed, which circulated between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also very attentively tracks the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those pointing out that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and, if necessary, whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse the adoption of such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay fines, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is then about substantial financial losses to the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated $20 million lost in lost revenue which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, indication of fiction, fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "we purposefully exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You don't want to run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has participated in more than 30 investigations of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several deceitful identities and it has followed and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to detect suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information together. FISH-i is designed to help FISH-i find ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Sea protection organization: a platform that provides satellite data and enables the position of every trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that formerly were fishing without licence and had little to reckon with consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishery turnover, since fishing boats purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia, the inspectors found on board towing nets whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries joined the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country in Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were used towing nets, which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also entered into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans really works across the ocean.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the government, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the recovery of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country, including in the plains of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north-north of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the removal of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; ultimately, the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, contributor at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest on the whole world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was regarded as the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, called for the trial of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As the meanwhile grown-up man, Quijano, as part of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba, said against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigated the crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that this was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, a torturer, and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis was not a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was the gendarme. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 until 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Intelligence Department at La Perla prison until 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quianos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows the great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have befriended you with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just make sure they don't run you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers "Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work at the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a big chunk of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>

<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes with home.</seg>
<seg id="288">At that time, the defense accused me of being a connoisseur of this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="347">In Kyoto's Japanese city, customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence, witnessed a very unfortunate translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "the Japanese word" "" "elder car" "" "means" "" "older drivers" "", "wrongly translated as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a native of Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, appearing in KYOTO, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The mischievous English translation was removed first. the term "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the appropriate, albeit grammatically correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation)," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists, who are involved nationwide in accidents, is quite an occasion for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005, representing 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens provoked 1,803 of a total of 11,850 incidents.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the belief that translators in the target language should not be native speakers in the target language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their mother tongue, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and enigmatic phrases that arise by machine translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this applies particularly to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them the enigmatic prints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Home of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) by the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presence of VPITV and El Capitolio TV was also no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online channels took over recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by oppositional groups, resisting the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was coupled and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that internet sites of Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelan people with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>

<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEGA fillies later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies or refuses to respond when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third locked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was put into prison.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelan an increasingly difficult access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a large family with little money overspends her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>

<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadacgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After finishing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization fighting for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadacgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the CrikDelta generally guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who have their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and can "make something out of themselves" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes the girl with him and justifies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and maybe even starved.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira crashed into MarÃ­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a cricket.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadacgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadacgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be" "" "no more Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Crikta.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo comes before court.</seg>

<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to do dinner for her employer.</seg>

<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months, with the adoption of the law, users would have to register on the site of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs across the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should make the registration. it is also unclear how they should make up those who do not register given the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="516">If I take them seriously then it means they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those who suffered from the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was one of Japan's prefectures, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbor Prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the Fukushima prefecture has had a nuclear accident, because of this alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which advances have been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The report also includes a discussion of the key vendors operating in this market. key Vendors â¢ This report provides you with a breakdown of market value by type of construction activity (new construction, repair and maintenance, refurbishment and demolition).</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that until December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (for example, a casetsu juutaku) can be relocated to final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 per cent of the evacuation, who, after the disaster in temporary shelters, was relocated to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1,100 of 1,100 schools affected by the disaster have reopened its doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have suffered wholesale destruction in the three prefectures of farmland.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland destroyed by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear wave zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima continues to be far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers find it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine a total picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feelings had changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is for those who had to evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to witness the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent spare-houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the current state of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas most of the evacuation stations are older than 50 years old. it is known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters people from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be larger at first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that it connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives, and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone across language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Emmman explains how the love for music prevailed during a trip in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of Ãlvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is commonly known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">The sugar cane industry was still standing still in the region, and the factory lost its facilities, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves anew.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuted daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are back in operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls to have heard that in MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and barely competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will surely enter history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban president Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of altogether 98 sugar cane factories, over 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened at the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about closing the factory, the word he repeated most is "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It dealt with officially written documents, which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed, addressed to the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, awaits the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a number of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop brings with it that the young participants discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a street section in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences caused by globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs have appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always control the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whaphoroostui Cree First Nation recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-group, who gave them a strophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the Strophe is available in transcript, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will lose our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and promote our youth as well.</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they have ordained for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, near the entrance, shokuhin sanpuru ("" "" plastic models of dishes ") are exhibited by any dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers will see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokimetropolitan area of Kappabashi there are a number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are usually so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new coated phone tapes decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been converted to kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, icura or nitrous oxide is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody that would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view other bizarre plastic dishes at: itinii's Naver matome blog post. or follow Twitter to the hashtag #, which is a very nice one.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry, such as the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trade" in Mexico, the extremists and those killed regularly appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drugs such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trade"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were caught in the battle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changes life") tells just these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who seeks secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who in only one day lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and look for graves, according to the people we loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="768">"" "on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again." "" "Emma Veleta:" "" "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need training." ""</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is here with me as well.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment, it has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are the insurance of my father, but she doesn't pay them, because they demand a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get those?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the draft.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he's big. and it's not normal for people to hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by the fact that they were" "" "sounder" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and are silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was pillaged with threats." in this she describes how armed criminals had blackmailed money from their business for month until they had torn apart the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are removed, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested for they don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence recorded by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy who consists of violence and had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council for Public Safety and Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, which aims to portray the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something appeared the first time? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been used irrefutably to portray tragedies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false combination of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in terminology from Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant meticulous reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, the dozens of houses enveloped, including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burnt to be unrecognizable.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That's Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been viewed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and incorrectly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports in which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images, the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but Baga's army base was a permanent conflict of conflict between the military Nigerian and the attempt of the Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo again appeared when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a testament for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments, such as this example, wrongly link the image from the DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report published by the United Nations those who escaped could be beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following one reported that brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which in 2012 wrongly claimed that President Myanmar's Thein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image from the DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news site falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein admitted into 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 on students, who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the now deleted, Katholische squarely related news site AnÃ¡lisis Digital, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar" jihadist attack.

<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo appeared, fitted with this Twitterhashtag, and sparked a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater alertness in these events, presumed in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the massacre of Boko Haram (and saved more than 9,300 times). but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message, allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos," about the Nigerian massacre, they translated discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it false.</seg>

<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the spider and some of them have image data in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may ultimately be a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two powerful themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions on silence in connection with the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitized readers and viewers and have the ability to empower empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will need to think carefully about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of wrong attributions should also take into account how international it can be.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsettable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the linguistic diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already carried out events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that assume diversity - secure rooms where people don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is often associated with understanding" "", "these events are instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feeling, creating." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story-teller, their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to concentrate on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamamara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboat in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fork, John Nyaminiara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started with the Puertoria Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open net.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, was dedicated to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist in France resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the Introduction, it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and writers who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of periodically extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken part in a" strictly secret "command of the Military Court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and were informed of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its place of residence and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project called Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more prescient than the work which he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to emancipate this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">He taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband in 2012 and 2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Divoino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique Airports, whose advice was given by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-setting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, which denied the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not finish any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the firm should have directed a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently kept silent and did not take reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media, rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been lowered.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young muslim and student of political science in Brazil says, the director doesn't have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served himself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is imprisoned:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison not only to be remembered as the first independent President, but also as a keen, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>

<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "et al" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims that represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"" "moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same character sequence as" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spacer), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>

<seg id="1302">"" "the phrase ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "+ the question word (la) on Burmese - very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hds believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it solves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on factorook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyse the mail and check it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat has proven that censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from publishing, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">"" "" "" "Facebook has removed a large number of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists." ""</seg>

<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example asking the Burmese internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems as though they have started this without a local context or technical support and banned words like "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely solved posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't contain any hate speech, but were removed:</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage law, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities held firm in practice, and in May 2016 there was a large public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, because that is, age does not determine the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights, the minors as" "" "defined every man under 18 years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were already married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 19 of 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were endeavoring to abolish laws to paediatric depositors followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the child before they should, darn't take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition took care of tensions in this really uncomplicated thing, and at some point doubted whether the opposition would agree to the bill in general.</seg>
<seg id="1353">Yet at the beginning of 2017, the bill against childrens was decided - despite 4 senators (including one woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave a status update on Facebook, which has once again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Clarence Rambresat: the bill against childrens was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">"" "" "" "the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws to paediatric had finally been changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, who is a minister of the ministry of education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk to disguise the core of the thing, but do you know what? the paediatric nurse is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentral - Thomas, which states:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about the importance of adopting the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriageable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft amendment to the marriage law was approved today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies, who were accusing, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The childrens are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>

<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organization.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take legal steps, should the law be adopted and he seems to have his promise to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Procurator Paris Al-rawi, a proponent of the law, said that it is quite legitimate when Maharaj wants to act against the law, most social media users desired to approach the debate on the topic differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Highshole suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Better sat, if we, instead of holding the discussion as general, in a way that can only cause panic and anger if we, instead of talking of the problem that the state, our daughters would protect them, that they may be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you be prepared to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child is legal or still the norm in different gradations, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was shown on January 18, 2012, in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has barricaded the popular and popular encyclopedia of Wikipedia as a crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share useful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use encryption tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been taking place since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary file system), when the platform abased all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names, making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After hearing the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansippedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported sub-hashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and staff at Mozilla's Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune an animal world onto the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarro (the manager of Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a phone call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already facing tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzzler appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he gazes at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and most of the time he lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the utmost care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm, get this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the Video Volunteers community and campaigning for the mining of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years Rohini Paz has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who don't name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided on this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Speaking out of the name of their husbands is a custom that they have to maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered to be deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in his luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "Patriarchate" "" "before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion underway with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Pays from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition in which married women are never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Even in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during the dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reported how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinciamber point on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the debating club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every stage of discussions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who they could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example how our identities are connected to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion group, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a salami-curta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, the morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of curtas (upper hemlock) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini make sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since the first stage of discussions, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tested it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, make it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own dress code - lie at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they realise that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1547">The Beatles at their landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter fashion, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit to the Beatles in Japan in 1966 is seen as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles Day of Remembrance in Japan. at the age of 51, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese also make pilgrimages to the well-known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market transfer, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "I will listen to" "" "Yesterday" "" "today and eat Ramen noodles at mutaro Koya." ""</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the Milange district, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was the local superstition that the head of a man-headed man could hold gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia reported to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 led a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect for kahle men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushai Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police were already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably disbelievers rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans. this attracts the police of the Republic of Mozambique in bettering (PRM), which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches generere.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha posted on Facebook the chronicle of the blogger arms Snaiah, which indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃWTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THAT I am ashamed of a country where people would have shame to challenge sex against good marks, work and other achievements, a nation where people would be ashamed, or even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the Albinos nor kahle or bald chairs would be hunted that aim to get to a quick fortune.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some could not miss the opportunity for macabrene humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Gado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sapange and the police spokesman ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both bald-headed:</seg>
<seg id="1606">The Mozambican authorities are very concerned about the killings of bald people.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his attorney had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk) after taking part in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case" "" "an internal affair" "" "and a spokesman said he deemed it" "" "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the pair in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the issue.</seg>

<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to conduct a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway for Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the import of salmon to China as the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she said in an statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1654">The U.S. Embassy filed an angry response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told me that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election to which they claim to be in accordance with the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer previously told AFP that Liu Ms., Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu was not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those rights for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the French Foreign Ministry asked China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information about whether France will ultimately record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">On June 27, China urged China to release Liu and show a greater tolerance for those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">Taiwanese legislators Yu-Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged, when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish because Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the International branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because it compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmuamalgam were not very clear: he defended an idea, according to which one cannot measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre pops up from the authoritarian rulers who are pretending to be democrats, abandoning the twisted logic, since it is better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged such questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to elucidate this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, who makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - either I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is right and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review sheds light on Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam commit" "" "good faith" "" "or was it a Freudian angel?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, but do not defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister have to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade tends to bejahung, Singapore is and always was a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We've always been a city / island state.</seg>

<seg id="1745">The standard answer follows my clarification: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly against anger if they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that separates us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has published a music video that has paroded the junta, which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells you which dictates his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems the junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that buying unnecessary and a waste of tax subsidies is.</seg>

<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Khardenava are located in the hydrocarbons of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia Minor, Georgian and Armenians, lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people, and today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the area amounted to 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken has been published on the website of our partner PRI.org on April 19, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the way to migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59-year-old Mexican singer, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-colored earrings in a teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Mrs RamÃ­rez, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, she buys them medications, which they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychy Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker for the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her text messages when she went on to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests helped her to prepare chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">On the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have seen what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula are from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children in front of people who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the passages, the travellers calmly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy to have her house full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly poses it to me.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by twitter-users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a phone call to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Clearing") in the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also used the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app would identify and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the minors' filter aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often bleak for those living in remote, oppressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, the authorities often associate extreme engravings and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which was based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police officers randomly checked out if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by The rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(" "" "Great Britain" "" ") also published a Jingwang product description, which shows that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council, to minimise the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard disks, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumqui's three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offences, including those involving peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslamlam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he slumps to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What one can rely on however is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips deflected with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which had belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fellows (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioning their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years of age, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind, and he can sympathize with the people under the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he has a special aversion against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee from the second generation" - he calls himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I'm a man," "" "while he shakes NescafÃ© in water into two cups. it's the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a senseless hot juncture has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking, the lugs of lukewarm coffee and the cheeks of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">At times, Jordan is like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look in the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior submitted an appearance to the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also affirm that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, Human Rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which asks the old-time legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporter of human rights," which continues to "advocate" intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear-crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional sex marriages by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who had premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trampled unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, Jordan has increased the number of "honor mores" - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Citizens reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support women who have become victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 frenzy law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely" and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I have been fooled by politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in Ghareeb the focus is on poverty again.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"" "in March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled" "" "Santandano" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a machined version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the 8th century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuevo, who was later to work on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not be able to do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service held several former deputies and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they had critical comments in social media about the problems related to corruption in the country deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs believes that only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and basic openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kind of democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">In Aomori, Nebuta is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warriors are fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from west Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>

<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gyoen for a long time: two floats are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru is experiencing - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the quirks of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hair styles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the Friseure "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts are competing against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdresser arts instead of bad advice that enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to meet people who feel expelled, to meet affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">The two young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation inspired her to the campaign of Cartas por la CalliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), which is the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"" "" "" "however, in front of the Columbian people there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace." ""</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and were carrying arms around the clock, have now to integrate themselves into life as a civilian.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, on the other hand, who had become accustomed to living in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter - who are then to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, Valentine's Day, but forget those they need much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people in this year, who needed most pressing attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never imagined someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as they did before in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">"" "when I looked into one of the" "" "Cambuches" "" "(a kind of cottage where the guerilla fighters live) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something." ""</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "nevertheless I addressed him and said," "" "Hello, what do you do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer." "" "I suddenly ran to tears for the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the grenades.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and he wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I just learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as a war, and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice in the part of the state turned to the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as a monster and even hate me, are just people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the land lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp commandant in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbian people were prophesied that peace would rule after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now focusing on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this disgrace?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents went through the whole WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just about to bring out some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt myself.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard one sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonour the family, you cry?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything in their hands and started crying.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stings in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which pedicures were you placed - in those of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknowns.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by going up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in Grozny on official television, saying that I hadn't changed my sex that all was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother once on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the whole republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a religious woman, but you have to vanish from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Thankfully the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plugged the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equation, it's a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian items inside me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with a camera, I really try to figure out how to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have been dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that they could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to face Kadyrov's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and say they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beards.</seg>
<seg id="2339">Since then there has been nothing new about them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already known in Grozsny when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sharia was applied I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately pushed us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore Tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Sharia has never bowed to my head.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't laugh at the calamity of another." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who laughed and laughed before looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorating steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as an active activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>

<seg id="2389">You know, many think of the identity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region in which a majority of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made big efforts in 1925 to end the ethnic autonomy all over Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets only little of this wealth.</seg>

<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime does not systematically refuse the Ahrazi Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, which diverge water from the Arabic territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by drought, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>

<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and surname to hide their belonging to Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to bear, human rights activists warn of alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuriel and was originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex continues across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" sing Kumbaya, my lord, "in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racial-motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often are referred to the school as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman is standing, who refuses to take account of injustices in her mind, which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer struggle for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women forever and again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I no woman?" "" "and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is historically a dehumanized and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of blending skin colour and sex, because some of them will continue to hold the importance of black women for feminist movement totality, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (for example: Afrika-Womanismus: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the spiritual elements can be worshipped, that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists are instantly calling separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither passing, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues in the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various data and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 advertisements went to the District Attorney Office for domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of police ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the adverts, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this because of physical abuse occur to every woman who does not do so," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, every ten days in Paraguay, a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then she gave up. this should always regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for such a long time from Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some blame on them.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") which consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with mental mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without any result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable juridical struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which became known under the hashtag # Porelas (# prince).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2533">The original bill foresaw most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that must be borne by the victims of violence at present, if they simply place an indication and want to receive a safe accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted at the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, among other things a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, mapping takes place with his approval</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or at all. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing in the global healthcare market.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic demonstrated the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡b health system.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Since the 1980s, Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outable Gorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn't use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or greenton or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cartons. due to these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton continues to breed salads, but it needs longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>

<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, nobody can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>

<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "open source" "" "seeds) is inspired by the movement for free" "" "open source" "" "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties and do not immediately discard - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Executive Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by cultivating seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, the latest examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking because of the increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore becoming available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out about one-third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be usable either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have deliberately desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for growers takes more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and co-operation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the company advocates the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property uses other breeders as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow on plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the battle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In general Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Anyone who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures whose cultivation requires mass herbicides, cultivates in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, make it the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still, the Egyptian authorities lock up content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticised and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abides in spite of this attack and the ridicution of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law to continue to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of flood barriers to the victim. @ anhri one of the main sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of articles and articles that he writes for non-accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of Canada's blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video on how police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The one to lock blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfatwa al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, a attempted murder, summons from the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 6 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, which was possible through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice refers to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which it can proceed against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The people argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers report in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old in school" "", "" "" "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "thieves rob Pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temse sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air-sea-ee to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "published on 16 August, the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published the article" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., but what happens to the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section called "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we, as journalists, do not hide our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, if it is distorted, can also be used to hide the atrocities of the police that first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues that violence is a "war." this is, according to her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountable to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of the military operations in Rio herself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglecting of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," says CecÃ­lia, says: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date information available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is on number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Apart from Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has repeatedly stressed the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police fire and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for several years, however, the UPP has increasingly been bombarded with bombardment after several reports of chicane and repressions against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also entails serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This demands the state to use means and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetrating into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an obscure point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police racked up the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident incited headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organization and the Syria Institute research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta Region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attacked the lives of hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition continue on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the need for locally produced or smuggled food by tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a counter measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" "" "life saving food source" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional foods that are planted in Syria, and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directorate of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in Portugal on 21 October, demanding justice for the victims of fires that were raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of October 15 and 16. this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone, roughly 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, spread farther and farther, like in a vicious circle.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say it at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahhabi in Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt unprotective.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services and no heating there. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we do not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high response rates. however, it is also true that the conditions found in the country are disastrous." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the Human Rights Organization" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be applied for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his innocent lives helped Asharaf to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked several years in the construction industry, Asharaf saved his entire savings in establishing a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was presented for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen personnel are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the pizzeria of Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and return to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily, if I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "they can sell their nuts on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are standing.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf himself has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: drafts from Egypt allow for shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, detained for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users should register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or a compensation of a punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member of the Parliament reached a proposal where tougher penalties for the insult of the president or senior officials would be introduced." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the legislative proposal, such a deed would be punished with imprisonment and fines, as legal experts from the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, it may be sentenced to three years in prison for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like over 700 protesters arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison line failed to bring the accused out of prison to the court room, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan mentions the death penalty as a result of one, so many human rights groups agree, the charges of fire, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza issued the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi session blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adaviya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists intercepted to unbridled documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was principally interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of legislation to grant businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption allegations of amnesty, provided that they return all unlawfully received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on the Nawain website on 21 April, sheds light on how the presidential plans look like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources stating articles 11 of the Tunisian press code which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he appeared as a witness in the Tunis District Court on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China compel the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to impose these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship occupied Russia with access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the provincial government as" "" "organiser of information distribution." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian Government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and force it on request for the cancellation of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnoctuniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has locking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to delete two English-language articles, the indications that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications declared that the site was closed because it became "an information source that collaborates with groups to amend a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government finds itself in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor 'programs that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecom operators and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation still runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
