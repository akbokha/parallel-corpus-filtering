this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the NSA has illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government decided against Ris@@ en and asked him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First constitutional amend@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they argued for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , re@@ porters and sources can always hide .
instead of failing to fail and make Ris@@ en a statement , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are secretly worried about his telephone cards ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit availability , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , justice has more den@@ ounced than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet been written as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been further developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest co @-@ worker , the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider , who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were told of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers can go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous corporation . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agency officer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people see this whole world very confusing , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always make it like a Mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka doll .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in this Dis@@ closure , this scandal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the US .
in fact , some US states need less information to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off especially vulnerable off@@ shoots .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator res@@ igned as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us all right up to a lawyer to make suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers approached us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a single leading politi@@ cian involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that things have started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the EU has been captured in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag behind .
representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a draft bill in both Members of Parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama @-@ revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who are getting up and saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up to end this kind of in@@ transparency by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get involved ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , che@@ wing on toe tips and closing my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had purchased from me today hangs in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pulled out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our Che@@ ese ham O@@ mel@@ ets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red the whole city with them . when we passed our last guest and the door broke into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former co @-@ inhabit@@ ant , N@@ ate Ble@@ ak@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
so we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the Internet , they can invite foreign people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but indeed they are not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I want you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic you now sense -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel if they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who is actually Al Gore &apos;s mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is condu@@ ci@@ ve to the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 jud@@ gements , all of which say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust in a key way .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to reject negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their jud@@ gements before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
little by surprise we trust people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bo@@ thers com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you get rather no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can we manage to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was previously not covered .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays could be a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , mira@@ culous can arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ dent@@ ary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know it properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course not every stay starts .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves , and this changes everything .
when traveling today , fast food can be compared . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would wait there for Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of a pub you &apos;ve never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the idea of sharing one ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were moved out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
there was a hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find that amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably the people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who never met Muslims : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern Fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I made a decision .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten .
no , not a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read him , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came this terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flying in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
to have an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should one do such a thing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went to my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said : &quot; be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Be careful not . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or by people one held for Muslims in the open and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to be constantly explaining .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , we can actually say people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumor in the US &apos;s body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic med@@ als .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there might be a few parking spaces available , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a manager of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from the belief .
if we want to prevent radi@@ cal@@ isation , we must stop people going to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which they can read into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have given their fur@@ y mind , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m reg@@ ained the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept trying to join the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian regime , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study shows : if people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ ung against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
in order to assign collective guilt , it is not only about explaining ourselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the faculty of denti@@ stry , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such a sealed young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , as well as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited her in the afternoon .
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and pulled out my shoes , and went into the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , are a thin@@ ker &apos;s mind , working in a noble thought Factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I &apos;d say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look to Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
if people like an exception usually appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air pack@@ ers arrived in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build independently lifting structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a subsidiary of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called Heck@@ starter ,
a flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in for@@ wards flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ern it can ho@@ ver , and therefore has big advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of tail@@ lights is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remotely @-@ controlled flying devices , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ a , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , there is a lot happening inside the inner life so that it can fly st@@ ably , and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern . to get it to fly , I have to throw it exactly right .
the probability of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ a is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in the room in all directions no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate double @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited .
we will now demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine out there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us the wage is in the development and the act of creativity .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns cor@@ ed in pure energy in a tenth of seconds .
for this short moment , they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us firstly arrange the events in time .
more than 1,3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life on Earth was created .
since then , the Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which may be caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy genius , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes dri@@ lled through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a con@@ vul@@ sion in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over , the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction , and the other is squee@@ zed into the other .
for illustr@@ ative tut@@ ors often lead to a really sil@@ ky dance in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed upon arrival of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by 1 1 . this is why the Lig@@ o employees were crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
description Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because this allows you to create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
the face of your child for instance .
instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s talking Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob canc@@ els her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p simple : w@@ up@@ p !
the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- someone who knows what he must hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar compound that rotate as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before col@@ li@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can - practically or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot from them about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , happen at the core that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe ins@@ ane , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars producing black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sour cher@@ ries for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an un@@ expectedly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; babies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I &apos;m going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , stir up life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am TV . I &apos;m producing television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : Sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America , my series runs on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs I have created myself , and not just produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I don &apos;t just run around on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not about dreaming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I had troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
as a result , there is a high sound , running a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m writing over writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I began working and working and working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t strive other than by size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called geni@@ uses .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more I am writing history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this bu@@ zz@@ ing . I love the sums .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the sums stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sh@@ et@@ ched , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regret , nothing deleg@@ ated , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show@@ piece titanium ,
everything was gray , I simply had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do , you do , you love what you are doing , a ban@@ ker , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another and that gives you the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I doing ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; babies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; babies &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am a Titan and my sums are rou@@ gh@@ ed up , and here everything changes in my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , can you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the bu@@ zz , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is going to let go , or whatever the girl lets in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sum .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium sum , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the aid of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is dependent on love .
the sums are the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
true sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the false words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t know how to play .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , for what kind of person does it prefer to be at home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we r@@ attle around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst into soap bubbles .
I feel mostly rigid , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fulfil@@ s me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replacing me .
and talking my teen@@ ie &apos;s daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , it doesn &apos;t require more .
everyone can bring up 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes by piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner which makes children ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz@@ ing , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with that ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my summ@@ ation .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sums of work are part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ u@@ g to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a titanium who is travelling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I listen to the sums . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , bear@@ able , bare and new attitude of life is spreading in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel these sums , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of that job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circuits so that the neurological function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells up the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you need to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do that .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the reception point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are re @-@ implant@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we could work with apes .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not used , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we colored in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity problem .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen in people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of three @-@ dimensional brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left hand side you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
look now when we reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you need to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you need to do this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
first , you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting us and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as an imm@@ utable fact .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my wat@@ ered friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succ@@ um@@ b to a false belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are mur@@ mu@@ red , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to high net worth savers and corporations , who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and could produce income with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ate in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not identical with the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop increases the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily turns the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my sh@@ arks with capitalism --
his exceedingly wa@@ st@@ eful way . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are critical to the saving of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which free and poor control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they applied to the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more crucial that they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same tendency to vote in questions of the state .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle shining bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations - became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , there is a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually under@@ lining the economy and escap@@ ing it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government these days , and still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s about as much as a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has so far advanced politics that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality is rising , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism exp@@ els the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ us &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only by a miracle a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by sub@@ stit@@ uting low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks greater , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts go deeper , just as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve the human being , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; indul@@ ging in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples , in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter what you are working on -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no expan@@ sive twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is simultaneously Liber@@ al , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally @-@ Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself as liberal Marxi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in some respects , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical of the democratic development .
what we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to repro@@ ach China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing , as we had the opportunity to start a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to us , and the permanent denial that a massive reduction line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the Po@@ wers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its constitution .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister or minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt service at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the mer@@ it that ran through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been going through a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither of the Troika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ically and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of it , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a highly competitive industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is there , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and el@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free .
and if Amazon goes out for nothing , do you grab , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top performance through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it slightly differently .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows , their history , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ oriented companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you gather millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work like this , it is a bit frigh@@ tening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies like Amazon and Google mis@@ understand something sometimes .
despite all these mistakes , data streams notic@@ e@@ ably into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the case of legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very intelligent people can use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized several patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do two things :
first , you disman@@ tle this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second you put the items together again to hold a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something where the brain is good , it is important to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but deciding how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will try it out later with a technical demo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and smar@@ ter . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it is still paying off to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
