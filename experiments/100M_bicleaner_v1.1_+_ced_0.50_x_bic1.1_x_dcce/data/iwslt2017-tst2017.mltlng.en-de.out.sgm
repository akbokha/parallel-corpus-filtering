<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to telephones.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA gave Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government decided against Risen and asked him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First constitutional amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they argued for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can always hide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and make Risen a statement, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, are secretly worried about his telephone cards,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit availability, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to denounce Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead, justice has more denounced than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">One such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmittance system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and has been further developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot secretly procure information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It's up to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the care of soldiers and report about overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest co-worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were told of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers can go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous corporation. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agency officer or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their assets in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people see this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always make it like a Matryoshka doll.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came in this Disclosure, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their fortunes in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have ties to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, some US states need less information to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US allowed employees of school districts to pick up school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed fraudsters to rip off especially vulnerable offshoots.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator resigned as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us all right up to a lawyer to make suggestions on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers approached us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not a single leading politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very dull as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite well that things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme was given political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then the EU has been captured in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have drafted a draft bill in both Members of Parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama-revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who are getting up and saying," "" "Intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and stand up to end this kind of intransparency by law." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I once almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the boot of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get involved?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, chewing on toe tips and closing my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had purchased from me today hangs in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulled out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [Airbed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our Cheese ham Omelets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured the whole city with them. when we passed our last guest and the door broke into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-inhabitant, Nate Bleakczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented ourselves to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the Internet, they can invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30 second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you now sense -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel if they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is actually Al Gore's mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is conducive to the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 judgements, all of which say: "he can really hold very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust in a key way.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to reject negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their judgements before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we looked at how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little by surprise we trust people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation bothers commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you get rather no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one tells too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great works of art in your apartment! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we manage to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that was previously not covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, miraculous can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know it properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course not every stay starts.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "" "is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When traveling today, fast food can be compared. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would wait there for Answer to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of a pub you've never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the idea of sharing one?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were moved out. Incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was a hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find that amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who never met Muslims: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern Fitness fanatics,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I made a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not a homosexual person, like some of my friends but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>

<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said: "be vigilant," "Be careful," "Remain in well lit areas," "Be careful not."</seg>

<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces available, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a manager of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing that leads to the person believing that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from the belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we need to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality which they can read into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have given their fury mind, it was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam regained the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept trying to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we accept rather an authoritarian regime, conformity and prejudice." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather voiced military attacks against Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swung against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In order to assign collective guilt, it is not only about explaining ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, and pulled out my shoes, and went into the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had had courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you're holding a TEDTalk, are a thinker's mind, working in a noble thought Factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>

<seg id="402">If you look to Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packers arrived in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently lifting structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a subsidiary of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in forwards flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglern it can hover, and therefore has big advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of taillights is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit doesn't matter in which position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago skilled pilots were able to fly remotely-controlled flying devices, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospa, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the inner life so that it can fly stably, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern. to get it to fly, I have to throw it exactly right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospa is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate double-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadcopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a palette of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most secure machine out there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and the act of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns cored in pure energy in a tenth of seconds.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they lit more brightly than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us firstly arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1,3 billion years ago, multi-cell life on Earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the Earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is up to us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which may be caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy genius, so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer gravitational-waves-Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 Ligo was started for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes drilled through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational-waves from black holes and their through observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a convulsion in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is over, the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction, and the other is squeezed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative tutors often lead to a really silky dance in courses on the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and stow, stretch and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed upon arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by 1 1. this is why the Ligo employees were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Description Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because this allows you to create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for instance.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now it's talking Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob cancels her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- someone who knows what he must hear recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar compound that rotate as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what that means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second before colliding.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can - practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, happen at the core that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe insane, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is hidden by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars producing black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sour cherries for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "", "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that deeply changed my life to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "babies" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked her if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" sawing to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, stir up life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I'm producing television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my series runs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs I have created myself, and not just produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I don't just run around on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I had troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, there is a high sound, running a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the sums that I'm writing over writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working and working and working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't strive other than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called geniuses.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things are happening at the same time, the more I write history, the more I am writing history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzzing. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Shetched, I want to go to Shonda-land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regret, nothing delegated, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showpiece titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I simply had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think:" "" "howl you, stupid author-titanium." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do, you do, you love what you are doing, a banker, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves another and that gives you the buzzing when you know the buzzing when the buzzing stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I doing?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "babies" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "babies" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am a Titan and my sums are roughed up, and here everything changes in my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "mum, can you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the buzz, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is going to let go, or whatever the girl lets in "Die Eiskönigin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium sum, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the aid of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzzing is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums are the electricity that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, expectation and pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzzing is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the false words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic." ""</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't know how to play.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, for what kind of person does it prefer to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rattle around in the garden, in front and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst into soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly rigid, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fulfils me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naive, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybird or biscuit is replacing me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenie's daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, it doesn't require more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring up 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner which makes children ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzzing, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong with that? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my summation.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work are part of me, but only one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snug to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a titanium who is travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted in the brain to influence the neurons "circuits so that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells up the brain and increases the cranial pressure in skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do that.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-planted them at the reception point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we are re-implanting these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not used, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we colored in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of three-dimensional brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left hand side you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Look now when we reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you need to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you need to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and telling us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as an immutable fact.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I became unequivocally clarified as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my watered friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succumb to a false belief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are murmured, our future gloomy, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to high net worth savers and corporations, who are too anxious to invest there where it would be productive and could produce income with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time circulate in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that are not identical with the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in an endless loop increases the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily turns the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful way. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are critical to the saving of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which free and poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that they applied to the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more crucial that they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with the same tendency to vote in questions of the state.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle shining brightly, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- that is, the world of corporations - became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, there is a relentless struggle between the two, by gradually underlining the economy and escaping it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government these days, and still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it's about as much as a herd of carnivores that so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has so far advanced politics that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations grows, political goods are devalued, inequality is rising, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism expels the "Demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demous" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can recover only by a miracle a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by substituting low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks greater, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts go deeper, just as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to redesign the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve the human being, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athens "Agora," indulging in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples, in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter what you are working on -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no expansive twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, in particular against the background of a reunified politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is simultaneously Liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and Keynesian, globally-Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself as liberal Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you said very clearly what you think from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some respects, if I may say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical of the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To reproach China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to start a new start with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to us, and the permanent denial that a massive reduction line went through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the Powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its constitution.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt service at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the part of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the merit that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been going through a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "neither of the Troika of the creditors who imposed this policy on us confessed:" "" "this was a colossal error." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonically and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of it, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very enjoyable minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a highly competitive industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted to where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the turn." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and elects eight Candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon goes out for nothing, do you grab, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You can record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked out.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top performance through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it slightly differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give to the shows, their history, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to figure out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went into a venture and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-oriented companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you gather millions of data for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work like this, it is a bit frightening because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company will be used to determine whether a release occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks of flu, the bad way, through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies like Amazon and Google misunderstand something sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data streams noticeably into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the case of legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very intelligent people can use many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized several patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you dismantle this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second you put the items together again to hold a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something where the brain is good, it is important to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn't have been capable of. but deciding how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">"" "" "" "I will try it out later with a technical demo." ""</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will be smarter and wiser and smarter. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it is still paying off to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
