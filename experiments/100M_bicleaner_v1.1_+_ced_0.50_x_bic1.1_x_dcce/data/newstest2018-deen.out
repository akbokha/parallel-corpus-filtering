Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren prison where young people are to meet today .
a chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one @-@ time basis of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories on days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not current .
everybody knows this , everyone who had to get upset , because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a circum@@ navigation road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria at@@ las , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian government of the state government , are anything but current - but very informative .
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called rul@@ ings , were incorporated into the big map of the map for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Sett@@ lement Administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and were ski@@ pped of the first sur@@ veying in Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Sett@@ lement Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the capital city .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is the S@@ end@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , that is , 18@@ 77 , the Munich subur@@ b .
today , send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasants &quot; rebellion against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , there is nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; judgments &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots don &apos;t show any farmers there anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is emerging north of send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße there were once people with del@@ usion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the ank@@ le of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , there was room at first , later extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ nec@@ ological station in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ East is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric atri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um are now meeting up on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ ean , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs burst into the city centre .
a big one remained to this day - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institut , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second line of the S @-@ Bahn line takes place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i state , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention to travel through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; it says in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently approved law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are hal@@ ted because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist offen@@ se against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel in the state during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General in which black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring che@@ wing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime programme , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws which ob@@ lige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ mö@@ n Project is a success project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
in the case of the case @-@ grab@@ bing of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ uties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into his farm , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday resorts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing trail for him for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste is exclusively regional .
since he is also chairman of the Fis@@ cal Year , he described the electric fence project as &quot; vital . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grass@@ land area ensures a lot of work , much has to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical pesticides and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he had no organic farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation of the land could be extended for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they will continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for their support
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants .
the open area is 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by leader , a quarter bore the municipality of Fis@@ bach .
thus the farmer left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Protection Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art support of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the en@@ cro@@ aching area must not be smu@@ g@@ gler @-@ economically ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ est@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 pitches , which would like to build just under 16 km of fence , is currently running for the 2018 fisher@@ man &apos;s bacher fence project .
the open @-@ air area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he addressed their importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to her , when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta kno@@ cked : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he put it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better visible on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link to the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that brings the American flame into the world around : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear .
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle remembered a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics needs to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h had naturally included were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver med@@ alists , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s so far best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
it will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , one to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain states that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be included in the med@@ als and the Fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he le@@ ap@@ ed in criticism , for sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to governor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have vo@@ iced their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compla@@ ined about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff left the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it &apos;s a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constitu@@ ents and to make his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , reflective and not profound .
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I was pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea , if a number of people take position on the same topic , then they are regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical critical articles and to arrest or silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook site .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of papers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people using pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed Am@@ ity &apos;s treaty , trade and shipping with Britain , were over@@ powered by the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project &apos;s online papers .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for local comfort in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieves his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is an ar@@ dent suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on homeland .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
over the past two decades fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer .
to this end , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) are in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household connections prove to be very complex
the construction work in the v@@ ill@@ inger street is in full swing and &quot; are somewhat in the season , &quot; said the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze farm .
in the area of house connections , the location is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of underground in the underground which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which constantly obstruc@@ ts construction work , is a big problem for the construction industry of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the mot@@ orists before red lights and shut @-@ off gates is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold Land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ arot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the Stol@@ len tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 p.m. , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence against Dutch rule , quickly appe@@ aled against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially split into Papua New Guinea and the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and corru@@ gated iron roofs which were transformed into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to her lively , hand@@ woven Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her pale skirt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua , Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it &apos;s also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua New Guinea is estimated to be 78 billion US dollars .
these fortun@@ es , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units almost $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
according to greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ ian demands threaten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
last year alone , Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will L@@ ate All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since events happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting @-@ cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local part of the country , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tasted the native Papua - the mo@@ m m@@ um &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised during his campaign to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua .
former Zimmermann guaranteed 27 of the 29 bor@@ ou@@ ghs of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Pres@@ idential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New Guinea has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ arot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in her tone and later returned to four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their rif@@ le @-@ bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
one child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was severely beaten to fall into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military service center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in a circle and a bird song im@@ itated - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started hur@@ rying stones at police and military out@@ posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ arot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colourful painted wood house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the rows of soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man , Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w , was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indonesian only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young prot@@ esters were killed and many others injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news of the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be gone through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto was a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of human rights violations had already been included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such asser@@ tions with fierce lack of belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother , Y@@ ac@@ obus , reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers throw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but local people say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on to hold the involved officers and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile Brig@@ ade from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua movement by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ dia and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s electoral campaign were not realized in order to raise the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the US states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council .
he wants Jok@@ ov@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a ground right in front of the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not leave those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ey with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cover the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest housing towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in only two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cries of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who named his name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed his great Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal to play Davis Cup only for this sport was not supported by the two @-@ thirds majority of the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also highly valued five @-@ set classics stick to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member states voted for reform , the aim of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the application .
even before the vote , after many contradictions , the suggestion had already come to the finale at a neutral place .
only comparatively small details are new from 2018 : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the following year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . , and the players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden items to the aircraft , find out a pol@@ l
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items smu@@ g@@ gled over the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had been late to discover that they were mistakenly sent with fire@@ arms , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also found that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent m@@ illenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of Generation X .
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated that while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the female respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the plane .
the company said it had questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally brought smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most often fly .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of items banned by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a time people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
Elektro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far suggested that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced for the first time another less da@@ zzling number in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had over 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition will just begin .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics always pointed out that this is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at the moment 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations were charged , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could be a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 illustrate how the market is set to change . if the company is not yet listed , you need to add the vat of 19 % . shipping to a german destination is7 euros . &#91; ... &#93;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently made per day .
those who purchase a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines at maximum capacity without any major disrup@@ tions .
many experts have doubts that this is possible .
if there is too much delay , then the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA manager P@@ ru@@ itt reco@@ vers due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not notice the complaint that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline expi@@ red on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly resor@@ ted to blocking or dela@@ ying regulations requiring the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator sur@@ passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Ru@@ le of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aks .
in a statement published Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt recommended that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards quite simply reinforce the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines serious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed the EPA in this week , said the group intends to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ress@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itts with surprising course changes .
&quot; it &apos;s wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the tru@@ mp government to turn to environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lin celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 pm .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius site a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ arc to their concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer registry : &quot; count Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ arc along with the Vog@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document according to the document , on the hill of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , which belonged to the church or patron law , and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as described from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third , the herr@@ ing settlement nucleus of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps dating from the year 1600 support these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , retired and occupied with a priest , continued to be the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
this was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ens of the two were wre@@ cked on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in World War II in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they pulled out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ary was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 , a storm ble@@ w up the steep@@ le and half fell .
to prevent disaster , the tower was broken off .
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organisers invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
local celeb@@ r@@ ity Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
the seren@@ ade of the seren@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers show the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ arc feel particularly committed to homeland care , as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to permit approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses to &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the Bo@@ is@@ heim Association has called on the District Council of Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days earlier by a change in the surface protection plan - but this had not approved Düsseldorf &apos;s district government due to a de@@ formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the approved allowance is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city coun@@ cill@@ or once again decided the concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recognizing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been entered into the circle since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to speak to the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city coun@@ cill@@ or gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were easily hurt .
the country road remained closed for hours .
after police information a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car in the context of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother , drove along the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and tra@@ der planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , the district of Bad Lan@@ gen@@ berg and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the shopping expedition to the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Business Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city is capable of apart from the usual supermarket products .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the city administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this is where the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first active day &quot; active day &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , discussions with all trades and hosts , in order to be active in active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly wi@@ dening , was said to be king in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , director of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities were participating in the country &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own self @-@ confidence in a direct environment .
two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school
during construction , a gas explosion occurred in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a wounded man was in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first se@@ wer was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as an accident , the authorities suspected of working on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ es@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
Tru@@ mp continued after un@@ brid@@ led telephone calls from Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border dam
phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp entered a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president kno@@ cked on him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr Turn@@ bull informed that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ ors Ford @-@ Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and gaz@@ ed through the wind@@ screen .
inside , the occup@@ ants flo@@ ated into fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cries torn the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
luckily this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience ki@@ cked off very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came back to im@@ itate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ ched from the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really unbelievable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our congregations , even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life long citizen .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want Law En@@ forcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff puts a cloth on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice , according to the FBI the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com stole a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester was sleeping with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they went away from the prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also evident that there was a conspiracy involving state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re @-@ production of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their portra@@ yal is clear , gri@@ pping , and is founded in a kind of deep racism , many of whom want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh here is Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Per@@ ez Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , who scre@@ ams the H@@ ester and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he has been with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he , wa@@ ving of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona said the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors wit@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene is starting again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this repetition is violent and quick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are cries , shots , and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice is breaking with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he remembered it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience went together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the post @-@ order with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which felt the performance of the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone wa@@ its Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he has already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ order is inspiring in some way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner opera in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f focuses on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ storey setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with Wall B@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Play@@ list and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ murder@@ ers pose as a Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stolen oil barrels remind of Ca@@ stor@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which is moving through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhein@@ ische daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderfully .
she seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ style a cor@@ pse into the trunk and give the Kra@@ kow@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ esen Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who humble themselves and viol@@ ently bow their hands to the Merkel Rau@@ te , are stor@@ med stor@@ my .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the gig was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Ca@@ stor@@ f and his team .
in 2013 he had to leave a source of pipes for himself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the single &quot; bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is happy to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience not only did a form of peace with Ca@@ stor@@ f , but it was also an understanding of their view .
I draw a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt at the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
lot : I did Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , working with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
do a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you are doing your FS@@ J .
you can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
for me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was just the thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering ?
amount : sure , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics .
you always have other people in your mind , each of them having a different story behind them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee is a young person taken out of the family - you always have to deal with them individually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts out another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend in order to revi@@ ve the business
the British training group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confronted .
the reduction of jobs , the general director John Fall@@ on , announced primarily for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghan capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , announced a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a Nato stance , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement says that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack of the country since the U.S.@@ -@@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tru@@ mp weighs up to raise the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 countries accused the agency for the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ados 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said they show the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and to react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to assess o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that report@@ edly boo@@ sts economic growth according to Tru@@ mp .
however , efforts have prov@@ oked the set@@ backs of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air that contains o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common council wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ roots decides to establish a common room in the future sen@@ iors &quot; residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot is signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot;
admitt@@ edly , it will still take time until the area belonging to the church community has been in the community , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common area .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering that such a common room is not to be seen as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent housing , but openly into the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision taken by the provision of funds for the running budget already has been decided last autumn by means of subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurbishment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , thus reports T@@ j@@ aden , enabling 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed decision is to signal the investor that in this respect , it is not necessary to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both saddle - what is le@@ aned against the surrounding environment - as well as desk roof - which reduces the head@@ count and the construction of economic power - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks , be this additive .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many buildings with which one does not move so well , for that one is now sitting in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am very difficult with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any existing or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but gets a real , in case of doubt market@@ able counter value , is the counter @-@ talk .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to ple@@ ad the suggestion , takes place in three ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is thrown onto road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and severely injured .
like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way to Hil@@ de by bicycle on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver in the same direction granted priority to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the street , he obviously did not consider the traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital with a re@@ traction lor@@ ry .
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup runs without him : David Al@@ aba has to leave the game against Dortmund .
with personnel care , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven pros lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the tro@@ phy .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the personnel will always get bigger at the FIFA World Cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at the Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must abst@@ ain from du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
the hel@@ pers are also missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official tournament of the season .
&quot; football is also tactic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to be intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ li@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights has captiv@@ ated the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
wandering in the resin from star to star
in the resin , the country &apos;s first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen , Germany - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet the needs of many visitors , was it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase through 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acc@@ es@@ sible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry Vis@@ it St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards is to be supplemented by internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting location choice .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path train will be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the viewers find a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it was far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Göttingen @-@ based Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the Plan@@ etary Trail .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail begins with its stel@@ es up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned at the exact distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a bul@@ let of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 metre distant sun is at least 70 centimet@@ res .
the total distance of the planet trail is about four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next star would still last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ on@@ enko will meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ on@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most thrilling boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Light@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ on@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ on@@ enko will defend his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ on@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect order &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I got up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on light weight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weigh@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ on@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Cli@@ ma asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that must fight Lom@@ on@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pounds debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also took interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Castle @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23rd .
&quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans were asking for it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight on the network offering the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ ons Lom@@ bri@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he possibly will take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ on@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ on@@ enko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after the tire plat@@ zer
in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the connection point Market wide , shortly before the connection point Market wide .
the car dra@@ gged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ erk@@ ette works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Br@@ uns@@ wick that optimi@@ zes the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first play of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , wouldn &apos;t the two opponents were against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ part chain is also to be optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch the gate after a fre@@ est@@ anding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that nobody else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the tri@@ erk@@ ette even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we &apos;re in the tri@@ erk@@ ette on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o Gi@@ ess@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand on four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not want to speak of an advantage over au@@ e only because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Radi@@ el and Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Defender of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are an easy favourite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep it away , just because we have the right to come to the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there &apos;s no team in the second Bundes@@ liga that you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so spark@@ le doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ ens@@ ische Medizin ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) have started conducting the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make a more accurate assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board ( Migration Board ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under age .
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 events and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under the age of 18 . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics over the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published in 5@@ 81 , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessments , in which X @-@ rays are made of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves evaluating the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is neg@@ li@@ gible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in that case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Road Transportation and Transport in the Regierung@@ sprä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure the schedule is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges run over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sandstone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning has now received a 1.@@ 30m wide and seven ton@@ ne weigh@@ ted bridge cap on the north side .
this is a boundary condition that is also used as operating weg .
at the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2,@@ 20 meters wide is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should go .
the special feature is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented brid@@ ge@@ heads .
the laying of leads through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires particular intuition .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs about the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the building yard and the Flat@@ bre@@ wer in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is completely closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge renov@@ ations amount to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest against German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so often that parties are pulling on one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parties represented in the C@@ RC ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day peac@@ efully , because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle .
and well @-@ known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ person Be@@ atri@@ x of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence in particular at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcano Eifel , he took care of such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ age is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 8@@ pm there will be a band for entertainment on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Boy .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ person Be@@ atri@@ x from Stor@@ ch to speak .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the police had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police cannot move - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one hits trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ tor@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top @-@ class orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
both unite the desire to transc@@ end not only the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach beha@@ ved in the two as in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by N@@ ils W@@ ogram , jazz musician , he mixes classi@@ cism , jazz and free play to a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this piece of the program was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ eved cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart says quite openly about bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bit@@ terly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette of act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten told she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but at school , she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announced that he was changing the party
the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party .
whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... Today I will say to you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won 42 points West Virginia , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth roughly $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile the National Republi@@ can National Committee gave an explanation on Thursday evening , saying , &quot; The Gover@@ nor Justice Party change is another blow to a Democratic Party which would hin@@ der us rather than work to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last refusal of a party from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive , urgent message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sport again .
Russia &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were grab@@ bed gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) report found on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that it is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships in London on Friday following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture by the IA@@ AF Council .
memorial act for Mali st@@ oked soldiers
during a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar about 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
as a matter of fact , the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masters of their trade &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and , on Thursday , accompanied by a dead guard of the German army in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took their leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most gri@@ ev@@ ous lay li@@ lies , and the families were on the arm of the coff@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sat@@ ra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the Figh@@ ter helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show doubt about the UN mission in Mali : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that was what the Royal House announced on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue her communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to be king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Con@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - neither after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ zo@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked at the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
while his later wife kept the sympath@@ ies of the people at all times , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly fifty @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ gel@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) res@@ ig@@ ns for a rapid re@@ election of the country &apos;s life , but he does not want to step back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday for the dissolution of parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising discharge of a Gre@@ ens &quot; party from their state @-@ day faction in Lower Saxony threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ vote majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets , former Green Party member , founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she announced on Friday in Hanover .
CD@@ U president , Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants his faction to record them .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Parliament , SPD and Green 68 .
up to now , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regularly on January 14 .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Parliament adop@@ ts its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws the trust of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally cleaned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;

SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party Members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also treas@@ on to red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their last vanity and fru@@ stration are their personal interests against the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony ki@@ cks off this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat it into political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator carefully and check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states issue the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all that we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
Al@@ di now takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has been dis@@ connected without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the affected persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment are available to consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are transpor@@ table and harmless to health .
if the back @-@ level content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not capable of transport .
un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .
this time , not the companies are to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to suspected illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too few controllers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it only lacking at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
there were just the official controls that revealed the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor &apos;s cases in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist is of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ ready food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the pan@@ elled means manufacturers , traders and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts will be promptly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football have on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ obstruc@@ ted expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules established in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( $ 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can surely make the money loose so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes down and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to work with legitimate sources of income , which enable them to even point their break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that originally used Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P @-@ period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million .
and while Plat@@ ini was dis@@ gra@@ ced by the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenue can be recorded for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the sponsor &apos;s value should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come to Qatar by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup ambass@@ adors are becoming bog@@ ged down and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators is easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G will mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey shopping .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shi@@ pper supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate is made for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white scra@@ pers of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros &apos;s subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss don &apos;t want to betra@@ y the number of applicants with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract by the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
since 2006 , the Swiss has been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights .
prior to signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
two and a half years ago , Swiss started working with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y to place the logo .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class are indul@@ ged with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class n@@ ashing passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y is also spread out on the short circuit both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gic goes in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising lots of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by raising themselves at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with adults playing adults now is less emotion@@ ally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the casting principle , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker Films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character brow@@ ses through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things dating back to 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ on &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy .
these are the moments coinci@@ dental ma@@ dness that might pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I perceive as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , is to be a spotted TV series : a roman@@ ian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a du@@ bi@@ ous propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it is moving , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited down to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef still visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can do anything for food for a v@@ ow .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian makers were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs Maf@@ ia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosecutor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz started on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time as ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 police officers were deployed .
the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drugs crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s Office has determined consistency against organised drug trade in the southern German region .
between the prosecutor &apos;s offices in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian nationals were mainly referring to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly grave mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has report@@ edly drawn attention to a media report on large gaps in the country register register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly grave wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , among them 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data was found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long since ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who wouldn &apos;t have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false attri@@ butions gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on dealing with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore it is stated in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF has been carrying out such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrants travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has given guarantees for the reception and lodging of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin agreement .
the internal political spokesperson for the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of the lack in the Italian asylum system , un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach have already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges renewed readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous as our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Hospital Manager of the German Red Cross ( D@@ RK ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
this allows three persons to benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported of the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a R@@ asp@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 % of blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a rein@@ forcing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for a rise in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest rates would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation fired by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs may rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the Mam@@ mut &apos;s economic package , which was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper banks as of the next February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forec@@ asting of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice since pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
at the interest rates it was repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling down of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; scale than the markets expected .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the pound was falling after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rate rise and the GDP increased from 0.2 % in the preceding three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .

the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening first gets worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; income ev@@ asion , &quot; she added , that wages are &quot; clearly &quot; recovered at the end of their three @-@ year prog@@ nosis .
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which compens@@ ates for some of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the sound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the exceeding in relation to their goal of 2 % was to attribute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; given the recent swap rate of swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages conclude , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by approximately 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for valued 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medication in the body of a person is present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medication can be taken every day or just two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics suitable candidates are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local attending sex clinic .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for delivery of medications this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence as widely used , targeted and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this big new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted and targeted people are targeted , it is possible to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delays and delayed implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that it will contribute to the completion of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
living the great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , moved from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne tells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi of Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel works are rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without having to mos@@ quit@@ oes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but laying the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is matter @-@ important so that when you push the door up , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or as your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre of some standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire
two brothers , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , are in conflict with one of the largest real estate @-@ empire in Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be shared .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in is described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in argues that this is not true , but re@@ jects Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ep charge of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started in West@@ co when he was in High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , with Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use myself and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and me to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the presidential media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly might actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said to the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship to television takes decades back - and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mr Tru@@ mp was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was receiving fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February compared to Politi@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption ent@@ ails a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign agents know something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp did not send .
if his associates have managed to keep him out of it several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented it from producing controversy .
part of the problem is that the people in a White House , which are composed of competing parties , are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
Politi@@ co - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the advis@@ er of advis@@ ors to provide the president for strategic reasons dou@@ bt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone willingly gave the president a printed copy of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
even though Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ane , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe sends letters to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , information from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences showed that many fle@@ ets were hiding on holiday destinations , calling it from Euro@@ pol .
you have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ber@@ ode has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .

&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travellers on the feet of war , who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire row &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dug out by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous citizen said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local taxes if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ warran@@ ted camp on the land beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to keep it moving as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be opened again on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambi@@ ance company gesellschaft mbH for the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council .
but above all , Freuden@@ stadt , mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les for a long time in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is undertaken .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already at a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer says .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he already had talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the idea of the city is consistent with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the level of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to set up exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just below one million euros , he expects .
the exterior spaces are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .

Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller allegedly used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
in recent weeks , the Panel noted the work of the Wall Street Journal , calling for persons familiar with the matter .
the paper regarded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N transmitter reported that there are already the first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence community bl@@ ames the Krem@@ lin for a long time to be targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the election campaign .
report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tru@@ mp private and business environments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special En@@ counter Tru@@ mp was personally involved in the center and accused the accus@@ ation that the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ciary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jury is therefore also called the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always done behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be sum@@ mon@@ ed by the public prosecutor to charge persons for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
according to the broad@@ caster CN@@ N , pre @-@ charges were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were encouraged to say that it was reported in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. was also Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the submission will show that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the demo@@ crats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in a statement that he won &apos;t know anything about setting a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in sec@@ rec@@ y , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he would not be determined against the President .
one has no reason to believe that something has changed , it was stated in the statement .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this alleg@@ ation , alleg@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been loud , he has to h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tru@@ mp asked him for setting up the investigations against the National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff .
that triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
unlike an independent exhibit@@ or of the congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ tro@@ dden President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators introduced the draft bill on Thursday after which the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : giant ice bergs dri@@ fting in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a giant ice bergs was detached from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the ice shelf .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the one tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large col@@ os@@ sus flo@@ ats north@@ wards and will probably take two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the last three decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no danger for people from him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to researchers , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the decline of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice r@@ ink in the region , writes the US Research Center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ tual reason .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ oss .
Sch@@ el@@ haw@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ oss is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
in the north of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ downs was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete ice shelf is dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there &apos;s a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ oss is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ice bergs did not increase sea level , as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only margin@@ ally , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ oss is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca according to A@@ WI information .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks on a regular basis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists are argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ haw@@ s will be growing again or long @-@ term and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers are not leading the demo@@ lition of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice rin@@ ks of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the data of the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the decline in temperature has contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free areas , the CD@@ U calls for the CD@@ U to leave the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the district day attracted 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are apparently very sought @-@ after .
about 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places which were to be published this year .
however , the circle continues to be lacking in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ graduates and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees who leave the ministry for disease or age .
it is high time to act so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had already made a mistake in the day of the business for a f@@ oul surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel expenses and ba@@ ff@@ led the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be reviewed , which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - should strive for a ho@@ stage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better for employees and civil servants than the tari@@ ff for public service actually fores@@ ees .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money can only occur if one changes to a higher level , oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who are campaig@@ ning for rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend Save &apos; , because their team had effectively worked with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosecutor , Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Jugend Save &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes ding@@ h@@ y migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly from traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can sail so that the ships can be used again .
at least one of these meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosecutor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must , above all , have an Italian police officer who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have so far agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants following the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; out@@ post of Berlin &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the woods and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again there was a view point at the lookout point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ve &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and rever@@ sible cabins brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters of altitude the group got to know the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga adapt itself to e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing against wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ des included .
these have also recognised the first Bundes@@ liga clubs who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed later by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , which founded an e @-@ sport section in the middle of July and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 were under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that there will be several clubs on this train . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will go into the stadium even in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets online than to send the federal government to Asia only once a year .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the FIFA World Cup simulation , will focus on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other .
and in the Asian games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the idea is definitely getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ outh also has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows a lot of biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of the classic sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .
against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the international level .
major markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the sports betting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ unde .
in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs are meanwhile oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport section according to D@@ utt .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to exp@@ ire only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot hold on to that everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter due to the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy has to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Carter was convic@@ ted in June for neg@@ ligent murder by Con@@ rad Roy who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until his calling .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosecutor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosecutor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not address the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted by the knowledge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a coal mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang on , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit by any press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was convic@@ ted of murder at her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ahm of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Extra motivation is not detri@@ mental .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me instantly , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahn and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the tied jump to his arm .
&quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria master .
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach as well .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , born out of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of vacation , but he .
most of the time , sugar is distributed to those whom you trust much , which you want to keep in a whi@@ m .
those who have been chosen to embar@@ k on the heritage of L@@ ahm can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sat over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
right back , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i was working in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated force .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy themselves .
V@@ idal tried to re@@ play his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus hoping to get out of the services of the Asia @-@ trip to Devil , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le in their first appearance in Bavaria &apos;s jer@@ sey did not have a negative impact .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm frequently did heavy , moreover , Sü@@ ver also tried successfully in the building up a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy stated that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also caught up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still open for the newcom@@ ers , one saw afterwards in the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy didn &apos;t give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but had six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises bis@@ cuit
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time t@@ ad@@ ing the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top in the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes to build a plan for planning , until 2021 is to be built .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west side of Trier , which stands in the im@@ penet@@ r@@ able demand of the Federal Traffic Road .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce and Industry ) is striving , as is suggested by Wis@@ sing , a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German Wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce appro@@ ves .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier provides an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
it is envis@@ aged a premium of 1000 Euro for the Master &apos;s exam and 2500 euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the Master &apos;s degree .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
at the planned road construction , facts must be quickly established , at the same time it fails to provide the country with the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to recru@@ it wis@@ sing at state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business .
the Chamber of Commerce claims to award more orders to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , member of the CD@@ U , refers to calculations of the invoice , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of national roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ outs .
Prime Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke for April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer the software to update in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install facilities for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rob@@ bing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the fla@@ ws of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , Volkswagen &apos;s employees were indic@@ ted , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was extended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a hard burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer over@@ propor@@ tionally gains Volkswagen &apos;s win . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich will take place tomorrow , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ uth .

&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a sensitive wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laugh against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was , at times , one of the most widely publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the no@@ xi@@ ous n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
among other things , in the first years as an artist , he represented himself as a sign for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the Six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his specifications , he still sits on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks still find its dro@@ ll figures worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ati@@ ously .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence under threat from climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and diseases transmitted by diseases , which causes major head@@ aches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn .
this has an effect on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a little c@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf ci@@ k@@ ages , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
cranes , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ aries or a land bearing should be experienced in the city centre these days .
the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from the violence , and while throughout the country there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are threatened by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez was leaving the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
at first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival tru@@ sts in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country on his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for North America in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without pushing the drug problem , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters liked it to be able to publish accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to handle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce was founded , she received prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you like to be a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could cur@@ sed like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Gui@@ ab@@ o , the bar across from the office , and always sit at the same table there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for the routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells bad , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anger is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters sur@@ vey@@ ed asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who designated the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters passed into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has wre@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expenditure that focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group that went through a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosecutor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , the readers would have considered Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers , which protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few characters and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame van@@ ished three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
throughout the country , journalists have become more lou@@ der by writing in organized protests , &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has been asked since then that she is re@@ organized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , involved government officials and a society of equal importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the orders of politicians and security forces , who had been hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media guard group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said .
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Mary Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have been chosen , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with high @-@ risk decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking is frigh@@ tened by him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of gun@@ fights with band riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via cell phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ts nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez did a look at the police officers who held watch to see if they were willing .
if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visi@@ bly visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern was asking me to send them to the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid his enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening one .
now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o n@@ oses of a Canadian mountain worker have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers that describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is ready now to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a mut@@ ing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ attack , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better blend in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the living animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution facilit@@ ated the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was subjected to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pir@@ ate behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence about his life , including his preserved intestinal tract , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died fell into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank to the bottom of the sea bottom .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just scra@@ pe a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived for millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried in the ocean after death and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor M@@ illen@@ ium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the reserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ested from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous blo@@ ated through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this particular specimen are preserved so well that the skin remains still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates covering the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a winning lot@@ to . &quot;
the more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .
remnants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that bear the skull of the beast .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass Kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometre @-@ long stops - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first data of the police , around 5@@ pm between the junction places Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into one another .
on the exact number of the injured there was no information at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a matter of minor to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large offer of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the Munich subur@@ b of Munich , a set@@ back of about ten kilometres was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there was also on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens one uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the head@@ less ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently underway on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many further long @-@ haul routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway announ@@ cer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have access to the App by train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you get into the train , call your ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for electronic de@@ valuation is then displayed for the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that Pas@@ sen@@ ger X is on the train and took the reserved seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket control at Place Y , he knows that a passenger sits there with an online ticket already de@@ valued .
you can therefore continue to sleep , continue working , keep quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel through our train atten@@ dant without ticket control , you simply check out the DB Navigator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Head of Marketing Management of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel on the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the driving card controls belong to the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking of your own ticket and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activist has come to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wh@@ oso Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was about the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ uson , Mo .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped off her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his rif@@ le and shou@@ ted : &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l recalled her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; typical &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ uson the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ uson is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as starting from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and of protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance that exists from the point of view of men who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ uson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; black experience and black condition innum@@ erable times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ uson , because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ uson was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman , Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ uson didn &apos;t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah @-@ leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager in Tra@@ y@@ von Martin influenced the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must carry the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , F@@ erg@@ uson &apos;s media cameras have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to one song and she feels bound to this memory since she went out onto the streets three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers will discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the topic hardly leaves us cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That would be great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while advoc@@ ates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then ble@@ ed .
in addition : the gallery is planned precisely on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wanted to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would like to see that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing res@@ ides in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be too low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why is the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is well @-@ priced at the top .
as you can see , shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre , as the rented equipment is often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad there is almost no special business and that which is still left will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery will eventually come .
or does the ghost @-@ bit gallery already manage to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces have to be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she was classified as a secret diplomatic message about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of 30 portraits , such as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp albeit a bit intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits un@@ well on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use turned into un@@ equal letters of letters , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future where the president of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome sort of happy coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little low and strong , since Donald Tru@@ mp is w@@ aging a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces , in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing challenged with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic spl@@ inter@@ ing , whose basis is sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological regard , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing how they appear with a hands @-@ free speech telephone in the hands of the United States &apos; discipline of discipline as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put out your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic si@@ gh@@ ting , which are joined together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also purpos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which her genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
a nationwide man hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford University staff looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Cook County authorities show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Administration is that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder , while the police actively sought the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them is an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ensis , Vice President of the University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail declaration that La@@ them had now been under@@ estimated and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the Grand Plaza &apos;s management team published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA driving plan to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to blame for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we won &apos;t give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
nobody is planning to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov .
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from carrying out dop@@ ing checks in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing scandal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the Moscow Mayor &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a pure precau@@ tion , no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ateral anti @-@ lice plates .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t did not want to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at the watch to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re@@ drill why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments financial web site .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ kol@@ re@@ dit .
con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
how G@@ LIN@@ T allows Con@@ ver@@ cent companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has recognised the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has set Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company deplo@@ ys Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers in cities or states have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ s- faster identified and addressed .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance given by venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , raising total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets .
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which used both con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees work and are engaged .
if the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of the staff , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , this can lead to dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you are looking for 4,000 ideas , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too heavily on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow workers , ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so deliver@@ d .
and after gaining feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the workforce and hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better relationship of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour practice before they return to the Water Football Center next morning at 6 : 30@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real pedal for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ coach @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as during six seasons in West@@ wood practi@@ sing practical exercises .
they will hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before beginning of formal preparations for their launch against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the player &apos;s busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they beat on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been abandoned with foot@@ balls that cleared a protective grid behind a gate post .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ eit warnings to third parties and show their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual checks , which may display the results of the invoice audit from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review was started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ tual fac@@ tions are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : it wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting a bit &quot; ) , it all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles , which had spent centuries in dig@@ ging .
he emig@@ rated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with community care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he was drinking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which ari@@ sto@@ crats said &quot; Oh , whi@@ p it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the period of English emp@@ ires , maps representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight two families .
guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ ton Fam@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought the insurrection was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ er that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ elles are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always paying debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot;
after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle hidden in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan hidden behind Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creators of the action have been asking the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf Chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her out@@ dated website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a central five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises against reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the general staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings , under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers were also present .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in abundance .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the commander of the army , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were shut down .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a conductor of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people allegedly involved in the coup attempt , this week has been negotiated in Ankara .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting up of the head @-@ tu@@ g ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
in any case , the wholesale business in the army and security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ruled another 73@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly regarded as the actual masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan su@@ ed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform plans of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is specifically pushing ahead with the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; warned an especially not @-@ so @-@ called officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army &apos;s readiness to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington modi@@ fies the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media .
he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will spend Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for road bus shuttle
over the past few months , the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les has always been cont@@ ested - now it should go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the mar@@ o@@ des , on which the tourist train de@@ parts , is to be built .
in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of road transport , construction work should start on the track according to the Ministry of Transport this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue ordering and renov@@ ating the Il@@ men@@ au circuit , the country comm@@ its itself to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Traffic Under@@ secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
the country receives 75 percent of this sum .
the contract , on which the shuttle will be ordered to be ordered by the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned treaty between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing platform Shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a rail link popular especially for tourists between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in recent months , a pilot company has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by a large number of people in order to re@@ order them regularly in the future .
the track is also partially steep in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he released his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot regarding the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less a most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their origins and their increasing sophisti@@ cation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will naturally not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they nonetheless remain tent@@ atively on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the boundary @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has been pra@@ ises to have women being sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the selected eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to real women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human being im@@ itating the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing suggest@@ ing independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : maid
is Tru@@ mp@@ s great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney a ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all supposed to ex@@ ert ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed is the power of tru@@ mp to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist Di@@ chter@@ in , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , has visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone they know , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tru@@ mp , we refer to the sali@@ ent possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will not be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself inf@@ ested by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ comic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tru@@ mp were indeed a very mild criminal .
when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York City Park , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are bul@@ ky and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ perc@@ ei@@ ving music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city will dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the themed pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and have all a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of having the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death gar@@ rison .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosec@@ ution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a stran@@ gely egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ eller from F@@ Protect and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Mrs. Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle that grows in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler im chicken &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it bro@@ o@@ ded by his chickens .
instead of a chicken egg a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , the eagle spreading its wings on a high mountain and sw@@ inging .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
the h@@ ens danced with the young kids carrying the cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ leiter Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young may be different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ t@@ ater that he felt accepted in his new school .
it was followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps in with teaching pas@@ sports , and the parent &apos;s representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber period is now over , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she leaves her students only very reluct@@ ant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in doing so , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ school pupils have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal tents was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulgarian nationals .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose will impose substantial fin@@ es .
the controls will be continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel @-@ drivers participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve exhaust emissions of cars of the E@@ TS 5 and partly Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates that are negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit was ordered by the German Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation within the next few months , but have not yet called a precise date .
Daimler announces to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers don &apos;t act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE is advised to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is a massive fall in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threatening ?
the ACE is afraid .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE tells you to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize giving ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the pri@@ ze@@ winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will host a reception and take part in the award with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar , who has been announced with a progressive TV series , has already announced that he will attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
for 31 years , W@@ acker has been Mayor of the City .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he talks in the press discussion .
he reports about varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet been submitted to the requirements profile .
the city is looking for architects or civil engineers at the earliest possible date .
this should be enough time for a revision , taking into account the regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Community as a Lower construction law authority , the applicant must show appropriate deduc@@ tions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would they no longer be able to fill in them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between authority and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a area and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have also been initiated .
the Kin@@ zig bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
the latter will be@@ ech with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it properly , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great scope for a city mayor .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted to many things quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city supervis@@ or emphasizes .
the City Building Champion already bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor will stay long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to be buried in Roland W@@ acker should have completed a degree in studying in the town of Has@@ lach as a diploma engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree with field of architecture and possess good specialist knowledge in the areas of construction and planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt sub@@ mits up@@ - and civil engineering , construction management planning , basic renovation , administration of the urban properties , urban working farm with building yard and garden nursery , as well as under construction law enforcement and monument protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bike on lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South Railway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track transfer in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a ros@@ ary sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he or the offen@@ ders would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger traction .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , P@@ ön@@ al of the railway customer could also come to the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum should be taken out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south track could be run without any obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of which concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesman Christoph Pos@@ ch about 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .
but a new study is exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna commented that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium tends to be too much in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been found to detect that a type of tolerance encourages immune cell in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works in people .
the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters the tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice &apos;s intest@@ ines were sequ@@ enced in DNA and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .
mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that they l@@ acked an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria were spreading to the immune system , the researchers produced L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that the mid@@ field player had his debut on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup began against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the Hol@@ der role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira have mar@@ ched at will .
but M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US State of Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens was the shape of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers , before elections , always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fri@@ ars from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the election warri@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ house watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with a head@@ wind in the approach .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one after the other .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal to the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again proves : red @-@ green cannot be ruled reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising faction of the Gre@@ ens of the Gre@@ ens has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election of the country , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green German Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has prompted El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets to return to her mandate to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD candidate gro@@ ans , when on Friday morning the new Job &apos;s message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own ruling majority after the passing of the green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ sar .
it is the provisional high point of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ er started with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades so@@ oth@@ ed themselves at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was it - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the swing , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te hau@@ led the party smoothly .
comrades in the weeks afterwards , comrades , were struggling again .
then , when they had just gathered new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus on the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because he mis@@ interpreted everything wrong in the crisis communications after that , what can be done wrong .
since then Schol@@ z struggles for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised .
mi@@ ese survey results came to an end .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the past few weeks .
comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz did not hide the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin .
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and don &apos;t even Schulz at all .
comrades therefore try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ sar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic as Madame T@@ ania puts her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ life@@ jackets is not elected as direct candidate because of her person but on the Landes@@ liste of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower Saxony MP continues .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins about an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as a leading candidate in the federal elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or if there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for the city centre III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed them on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a look back on what was happening .
since 1991 , there have been re@@ development areas .
at that time , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renovation projects are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to support the interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 I received the information from the President of the Government of Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation zone III .
the funding amount is 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality of sensi@@ tivities .
how does a remedi@@ ation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continues , to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there are any interest in the planned territory .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries may be postpon@@ ed again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renovation would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the remedi@@ ation area would then finally be defined as a by@@ law .
the subsi@@ dy period for the funds has been running since January 1 , 2017 till April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the order intake should be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commune had to carry out the said screening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to refurb@@ ish and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a refurbishment note in the land register will be recorded for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ bility and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that the cooperation of the participants is an essential success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , about the structural state and the rehabilitation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when operating in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel suggested that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still emphas@@ ised that the distribution of funds worked according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whoever comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve money for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , photographs of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stage II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pal@@ atable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor deplo@@ ys itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory es@@ the@@ tist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks at homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House advertising costs cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s specifications , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was issued next to a yacht made from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ man car and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the Deputy Nav@@ al Officer for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was cleared this evening .
the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to restric@@ ting the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the meeting with the helicopter while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a push for reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Navy One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo op is unusual .
in February , Tru@@ mp passed a test in February when the presidential aircraft crashed against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the President &apos;s aircraft by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokesman for Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget desig@@ nations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at this time , the former spokes@@ woman of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW N@@ uss in front of tricky task
the top @-@ runner of the second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga is the third @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will be appearing tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite after five games of still flaw@@ less balance , the top @-@ runner of the second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga was given the sense of the reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team , always playing in a rather similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I find the team very good at the back positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tru@@ mp did not act when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress wrapped up a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US initiative .

the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .

Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the Hit@@ row from Net@@ fli@@ x will be the center of attention
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over .
the relay teams three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the world &apos;s most successful drug trade organisation : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a For@@ tune 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with more government bri@@ bery and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role revers@@ al : the city has 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch @-@ table again .
with solid contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
on 1 September , Kre@@ feld took over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking continues out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kite year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 hours of a week eat in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 : 00 . &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen staff from September 1 : they warm up the delivered food , add salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , leave the meal , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ group units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assistants now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
even for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita premises - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with about 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , official leader of the United Nations Mission , said hundreds of women in the provinces are going to run in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible when women fully participate and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban has published threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international struggles to an advisory role .
this year the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan National Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .

G@@ MB concerns about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in Man@@ agers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , manufactures Hob@@ bies and R@@ ich Tea biscuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s GM branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns about the financing of modernis@@ ation of production lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB senior organizer , Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross concerns our members deeply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers strongly focus on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is in urgent need of a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland last night , and the company will react directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
La Liga homepage likes to regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not succ@@ um@@ b to its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having delivered an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago from the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach launched the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , where Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans stand is that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world viewed three years ago by the PS@@ G President prior to this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .
sco@@ oter upset and damaged
in the night of Friday to Saturday an unknown perpetr@@ ator intentionally turned a sco@@ oter in the royal fields street in front of the property number 30 sco@@ oters , and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle to damage of more than 200 euros .

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him in his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um had arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to leave to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console .
in passenger cars , material damage was created .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident victims , it may well be that the accident driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the poll@@ uter vehicle to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ spar@@ row report rati@@ fies Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use falls is reli@@ eved by Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokesman for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after the publication of the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ en@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would very much serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then wrong assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence against the Dom@@ spar@@ es was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a cute feeding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put@@ ts were a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be finished with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on abuse of mis@@ use , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann attributed to R@@ atz@@ inger wrote the reminder book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the clari@@ fication of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victim of assault , 67 cathedral @-@ cats sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in various forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims estimate that many victims estimate the common humanity of R. and , in many cases , even bring positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on protective tari@@ ffs at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; shows a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became pal@@ p@@ able to the latter when a cathedral kit did not bring top performance musically .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : if you take the effort and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside his sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , know it too late , or have not taken first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , described him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and candy , and &quot; always surrounded by children of grapes . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which led to rup@@ tures .
the fact that he did not just kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also distributed ear@@ ch@@ okes and drew too che@@ ek@@ y boys to the ears or ears , he himself admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .
do you know such methods of breeding ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are true Bag@@ at@@ elles .
there is a question of whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just collap@@ sed on him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report rati@@ fies Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , a great deal was reported about abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if they did not even touch parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain time .
how do you assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ student role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a du@@ bi@@ ous student put it in such a way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely findings and could have stopped the respective cul@@ pri@@ t .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was counting on him ... Bu@@ cks more penet@@ rating or clearer or even more open than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trusted teachers , etc .
that you talk about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students involved in the run @-@ up to him and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any co @-@ existence .
it cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying it .
therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these vile crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence obs@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and mixed up into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
it is clearly separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows .
the whole aw@@ ful ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys were literally victi@@ mi@@ zed and portrayed by sa@@ di@@ stic teachers , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz Gymnasium .
on that was , as most of the witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; tab@@ oo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimate the common humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation still remains to be taken away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then only about 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger rigor@@ ously close the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended penet@@ rating intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows .
it was hard to estimate for him , where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the official punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis stated that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the times of that time .
how do you see it ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has been right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is , to draw ear files and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s .
when corpor@@ al punishment then was forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ in@@ cy also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells us from his perspective , that the Dom@@ spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not conc@@ eal that he carried out a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once again : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscuits and can@@ dies alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys don &apos;t make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael H@@ atz@@ inger : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thoroughly and experienced again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deeply believing and hear@@ tless people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something else just a fly .
I regularly get contact with him , like many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ spar@@ es are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certain that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up today and which they almost ven@@ er@@ ate .
and please , again quite clearly : all that you repro@@ ach him are the methods of education that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , all too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the An@@ war would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally let it in peace .
