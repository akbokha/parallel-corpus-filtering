<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren prison where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the one-time basis of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not current.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, everyone who had to get upset, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a circumnavigation road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian government of the state government, are anything but current - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called rulings, were incorporated into the big map of the map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Settlement Administration between 1810 and 1864 and were skipped of the first surveying in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished to get an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card were.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Settlement Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The information sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive example of the capital city.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is the Sendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, that is, 1877, the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasants "rebellion against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, there is nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flurpieces from the so-called "judgments" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots don't show any farmers there anymore - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is emerging north of sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "On the air" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße there were once people with delusion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district" "" "On the air" "" "was created in 1858 / 59." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the ankle of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the staff to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, there was room at first, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gynecological station in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Klinikum in Munich-East is one of Germany's largest psychiatric atrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesanum are now meeting up on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenean, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, the" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "" "was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombs burst into the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institut, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second line of the S-Bahn line takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri state, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur throughout the state and be noted here," it says in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately aim at minorities, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are halted because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offense against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel in the state during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Office of the Missouri Attorney General in which black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel said." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring chewing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime programme, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states adopted immigration laws which oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race profiling according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidemön Project is a success project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the case of the case-grabbing of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his farm, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments holiday resorts.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing trail for him for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste is exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also chairman of the Fiscal Year, he described the electric fence project as "vital."</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot profitably manage on such steep faces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area ensures a lot of work, much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here to fight with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical pesticides and fertilizers, even if he had no organic farm.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they will continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open area is 40 hectares, which may not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by leader, a quarter bore the municipality of Fisbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmer left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "here the best foods are produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Protection Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state-of-the-art support of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the encroaching area must not be smuggler-economically (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 pitches, which would like to build just under 16 km of fence, is currently running for the 2018 fisherman's bacher fence project.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he addressed their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to her, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta knocked: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better visible on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism, presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link to the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the world around: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not lighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred which is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembered a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh had naturally included were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth-silver medalists, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's so far best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman, one to watch for a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain states that they are "enormously proud" to the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be included in the medals and the Finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammate voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to sit on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not apply to a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He leaped in criticism, for sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "in 1783, Washington said," "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff left the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it's a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his constituents and to make his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called official and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, reflective and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I was polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take position on the same topic, then they are regarded by some rather than a so-called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the staff of the Governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical critical articles and to arrest or silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook site.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At Washington's time, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck him.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people using pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions that criticized Amity's treaty, trade and shipping with Britain, were overpowered by the historic documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.</seg>

<seg id="258">It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces.</seg>
<seg id="259">An existing movement, which stirred up the independence against Dutch rule, quickly appealed against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="273">In addition, Papua New Guinea is estimated to be 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">These fortunes, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nabire airport.</seg>

<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change as its agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not notice the complaint that was raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline expired on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for down-to-earth ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid" "" "interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was the prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations requiring the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pitts regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator surpassed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by groups of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius site a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters Tumarc to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village gem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer registry: "count Hermann von Sulz" sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumarc along with the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document according to the document, on the hill of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, which belonged to the church or patron law, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"" "as described from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" "" "mountain" "" "the third, the herring settlement nucleus of the village." ""</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating from the year 1600 support these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, retired and occupied with a priest, continued to be the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greens of the two were wrecked on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They pulled out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from radio schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilary was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834, a storm blew up the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent disaster, the tower was broken off.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius plant as successor to Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite friends and supporters of Tumarc on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Local celebrity Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim refuses to" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The Boisheim Association has called on the District Council of Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his permit for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, because at the time in Viersen only at the border of Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are meant to prevent" "" "saving" "" "the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette, a few days earlier by a change in the surface protection plan - but this had not approved Düsseldorf's district government due to a deformation.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare area.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to about one fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city councillor gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="907">In April the work began at the same time on all three rehabilitating bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure the schedule is kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure the stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges run over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, 10.60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning has now received a 1.30m wide and seven tonne weighted bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a boundary condition that is also used as operating weg.</seg>
<seg id="919">At the southern part of the bridge, a width of 2,20 meters wide is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should go.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special feature is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridgeheads.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of leads through the building in Lauterbach requires particular intuition.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts about the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football have on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unobstructed expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules established in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make the money loose so that Neymar writes down and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to work with legitimate sources of income, which enable them to even point their break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that originally used Roman Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP-period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And while Platini was disgraced by the presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenue can be recorded for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalonian company could sponsor the PSG if the sponsor's value should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar World Cup ambassadors are becoming bogged down and such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators is easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG will mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey shopping.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-evil plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the excourses are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments coincidental madness that might preheat this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I perceive as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the gang of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its east-west wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, is to be a spotted TV series: a romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synced by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a dubious propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it is moving, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited down to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, because Gregor and Iosef still visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz started on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, officials ordered large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the same time as raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians there were German arrest warrants.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne tells.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a closet space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms above each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked on top of each other, without having to mosquitoes." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but laying the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," says Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is matter-important so that when you push the door up, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or as your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and conduct a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre of some standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers, after their Italian family founded the dynasty, are in conflict with one of the largest real estate-empire in Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be shared.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin is described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means Colin's property worth $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">"" "" "" "last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place." ""</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but rejects Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, in which Colin opened the first jeep charge of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started in Westco when he was in High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old). "</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the presidential media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly might actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said to the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television takes decades back - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Mr Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was receiving fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February compared to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "at the time, Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption entails a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign agents know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates have managed to keep him out of it several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from producing controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that the people in a White House, which are composed of competing parties, are trying again and again to present their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - entirely devoted to this story - reported in May about the adviser of advisors to provide the president for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone willingly gave the president a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of chicane, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork," "" "he added." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the hotel Birkenhof by the then ambiance company gesellschaft mbH for the 13th of April 2014, approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt, mayor Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective buyers at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles for a long time in front of the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller allegedly used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks, the Panel noted the work of the Wall Street Journal, calling for persons familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1484">Us intelligence community blames the Kremlin for a long time to be targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Reportedly, Mueller also examined more and more trump private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Encounter Trump was personally involved in the center and accused the accusation that the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the wake of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also called the Prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always done behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be summoned by the public prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the broadcaster CNN, pre-charges were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were encouraged to say that it was reported in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. was also Trumps's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election leader Paul Manafort at the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the submission will show that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "however, the suspension of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump." ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">One has no reason to believe that something has changed, it was stated in the statement.</seg>

<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After representation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice rink in the region, writes the US Research Center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual reason.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C Scheloss.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelhaws swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Scheloss is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">In the north of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and breakdowns was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete ice shelf is discernible there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There's a lot to say that the Larsen-C Scheloss is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and ice bergs did not increase sea level, as they float on the water and pushed ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only marginally, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Scheloss is the fourth-largest ice shelf of Antarctica according to AWI information.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most popular retreat since the beginning of records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists are arguing whether the Larsen-C-Schelhaws will be growing again or long-term and possibly collapsing, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers are not leading the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, many ice rinks of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the data of the research program British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German relief organisation 'Jugend Save', because their team had effectively worked with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>

<seg id="1588">At least one of these meetings allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>

<seg id="1627">In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the FIFA World Cup simulation, will focus on competition level.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobouth also has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows a lot of biological and physical responses that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Among other things, in the first years as an artist, he represented himself as a sign for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the Sixties: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his specifications, he still sits on the drawing table today, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks still find its droll figures worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counter-player.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D movie, which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence under threat from climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and diseases transmitted by diseases, which causes major headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past few years and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a little cicade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarf cikages, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long vegetable ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office that were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from the violence, and while throughout the country there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are threatened by attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodoce Building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the reason, we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez was leaving the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival trusts in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country on his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for North America in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to run journalism without pushing the drug problem," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters liked it to be able to publish accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after Rioodoce was founded, she received prestigious" "" "Maria moors Cabot Award" "" "for her coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could cursed like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guiabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for the routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells bad, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters surveyed asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who designated the governor himself as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters passed into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has wrecked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of former well-known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditure that focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that went through a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers, which protest against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame vanished three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become more louder by writing in organized protests, "SOS Press," on sidewalks and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since then that she is reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, involved government officials and a society of equal importance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, Narco Journalism, he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces, who had been hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" was assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," Ramirez said.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1928">"" "his unbelievably well preserved condition has startled researchers that describe it as" "" "really remarkable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is ready now to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a muting tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-attack, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better blend in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the living animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution facilitated the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was subjected to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong pirate behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence about his life, including his preserved intestinal tract, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur when he died fell into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank to the bottom of the sea bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried in the ocean after death and mummified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the reserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protested from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous bloated through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this particular specimen are preserved so well that the skin remains still bumpy armoured plates covering the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as "rare as a winning lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that bear the skull of the beast.</seg>

<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have access to the App by train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often travel on the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the driving card controls belong to the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one has, in any case, one of the contributors not all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in checking of your own ticket and the Schaffner at the end takes time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that also applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns lifeless body stretching out on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "said Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She dropped off her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Browns father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.</seg>

<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas starting from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and of protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance that exists from the point of view of men who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "black experience and black condition innumerable times before this morning."</seg>

<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>

<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "one question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah-leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprising personal aspects of Ferris's life, how she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's story repeated the role of black gay women in the wider black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenager in Trayvon Martin influenced the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">Meanwhile, Ferguson's media cameras have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic hardly leaves us cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>

<seg id="2094">While advocates build a gallery to attract more customers to the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned precisely on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces have to be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptibly alike - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she was classified as a secret diplomatic message about WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming Stresemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created out of 30 portraits, such as someone with these genomic data, a sharp albeit a bit intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits unwell on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse turned into unequal letters of letters, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic book" "" "Suppressed Images" "", "which foresaw a future where the president of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome sort of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little low and strong, since Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces, in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning challenged with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the "automatic splintering, whose basis is sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological regard, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how they appear with a hands-free speech telephone in the hands of the United States' discipline of discipline as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic sighting, which are joined together like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett did not want to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up but the polls didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at the watch to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaints hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow to bypass the C Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company, which shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can redrill why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber, who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments financial web site.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Miskolredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">How GLINT allows Convercent companies to send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has recognised the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has set Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Previously, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company deploys Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers in cities or states have been hidden - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practics- faster identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "prior to using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance given by venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising considering the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which used both convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees work and are engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and commitment of the staff, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you are looking for 4,000 ideas, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow workers, ask yourself," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care about it, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT, so deliverd.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gaining feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the workforce and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better relationship of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: it wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles, which had spent centuries in digging.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with community care, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he was drinking" "" "Whiskey and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust did not receive full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, whip it on the attic. "</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' followed by a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 1381.</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises against retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the building of the general staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">At the meetings, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers were also present.</seg>
<seg id="2344">As a result, the civilians in the YAS were in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The commander of the army, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a conductor of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people allegedly involved in the coup attempt, this week has been negotiated in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a "gift of God," because he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article titled "Unease in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting up of the head-tug ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the wholesale business in the army and security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan ruled another 7395 state servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly regarded as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan sued the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform plans of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is specifically pushing ahead with the Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">The magazine "Vocal Europe" warned an especially not-so-called officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey when he released his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot regarding the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "who would make a stepford woman progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion, with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as much as possible," "" "enthuses True Companion's website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be in the mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e.: reluctant) Farrah, restless a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "says it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will naturally not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they nonetheless remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the boundary-zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has been praises to have women being sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphical images, the intricate body and the selected eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to real women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human being imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing suggesting independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Is Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney a epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to exert ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trump to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist Dichterin, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, has visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone they know, including the Republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing for the dining table, but it is important to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the salient possibility that one day his bibs will not be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing" "" "normalize" "" "that suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to his standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump were indeed a very mild criminal.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York City Park, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are bulky and the animals are twisting to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perceiving music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city will disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to provide much excitement, and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of having the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrist, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death garrison.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna commented that immune cells are patrolling in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to be too much in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found to detect that a type of tolerance encourages immune cell in mice carrying a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that fosters the tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was housed separately, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice's intestines were sequenced in DNA and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were wound up in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received L. reuteri and immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria were spreading to the immune system, the researchers produced L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to rehabilitate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development informed them on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a look back on what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been redevelopment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous renovation projects are a "success project" - it is also important to support the interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4 I received the information from the President of the Government of Karlsruhe that there will be a renovation zone III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount is 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the municipality of sensitivities.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovation would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would then finally be defined as a bylaw.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The subsidy period for the funds has been running since January 1, 2017 till April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, the survey would take place only once, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Navy One, when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht made from Maine, a Wisconsin fireman car and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the HMX-1 commander on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the Deputy Naval Officer for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and stayed until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was cleared this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight departure from the White House should be delayed due to restricting the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not succumb to its persecution of Neymar after having delivered an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago from the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach launched the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sportsman in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalans stand is that the club always has his best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world viewed three years ago by the PSG President prior to this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domsparrow report ratifies Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse falls is relieved by Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnes, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," announced after the publication of the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domencapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would very much serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that reporting on violence against the Domspares was measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In terms of assaults in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, as the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "you like to go to the church and that's a cute feeding."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "putts were a very normal educational tool" "", "to be finished with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on abuse of misuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann attributed to Ratzinger wrote the reminder book "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domsparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s "with high plausibility" victim of assault, 67 cathedral-cats sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. has been used in various forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims estimate that many victims estimate the common humanity of R. and, in many cases, even bring positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on protective tariffs at the Regensburger Domspatzen" shows a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students highlight his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choline and perfectionist, who became palpable to the latter when a cathedral kit did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hatzinger: if you take the effort and read the full 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Just eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also expropriated outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, know it too late, or have not taken first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatz gymnasium on which it worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his pupils, Georg Ratzinger, described him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy, and "always surrounded by children of grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which led to ruptures.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not just kneel with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also distributed earchokes and drew too cheeky boys to the ears or ears, he himself admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such methods of breeding?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence at the preschool, these are true Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">There is a question of whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just collapsed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report ratifies Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a great deal was reported about abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "said one of those affected," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the real problem with the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even touch parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you assess Ratzinger's Domspatzen-student role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a dubious student put it in such a way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely findings and could have stopped the respective culprit.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was counting on him... Bucks more penetrating or clearer or even more open than compared to their parents, dormitory managers, trusted teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this results in the clear result:" "" "the students involved in the run-up to him and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-existence.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these vile crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media much of" "" "violence obsessed" "" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything mixed and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">It is clearly separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domsparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally victimized and portrayed by sadistic teachers, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the Domspatz Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On that was, as most of the witnesses stress, the subject of "primary school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "conditions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatz gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimate the common humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation still remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then only about 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger rigorously close the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended penetrating intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was hard to estimate for him, where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the official punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis stated that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the times of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, to draw ear files and to the hair and ears were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When corporal punishment then was forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "has shown Georg Ratzinger in his conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examincy also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells us from his perspective, that the Domsparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not conceal that he carried out a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once again: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, the rebellious boys don't make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hatzinger: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger thoroughly and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believing and heartless people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something else just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get contact with him, like many former Domsparrows today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspares are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certain that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up today and which they almost venerate.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again quite clearly: all that you reproach him are the methods of education that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Anwar would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally let it in peace.</seg>
