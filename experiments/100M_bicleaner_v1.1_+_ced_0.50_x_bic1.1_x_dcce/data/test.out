28 @-@ year @-@ old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother remarks that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the Court of Justice in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had reg@@ ained his dream job six months ago as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank was first living in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to connect with his family was to always cook us something , to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any sort of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ cut diamond that bri@@ gh@@ tened every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the phone calls on the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or get stuck on the outside label , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ chy to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of television with delicious D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not have been married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for some di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in the fast gal@@ lop home to the food comfort .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the mount stopped again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournaments wins - again near horses .
he let himself be guided with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , he did not even float on a horse for photo purposes .
for the first time in Aachen , the first time was the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spor@@ thilfe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Golden sport pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no lack of sympathy for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ rie @-@ leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 18th prize winner of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sport@@ pyr@@ ami@@ dion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a long one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Aachen he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this distinction means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only for@@ given for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time U.S. Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ chis@@ ee , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sport legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept far from the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US Pres@@ idential candidates are in a fundamental issue , however , in tax and energy policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are underlying philosophical differences .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep this in doubt rather small and cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with tax and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be entirely different , says Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will speed up regulation and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why the taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in those that must be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ ego@@ at wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
on Tru@@ mp , therefore , party @-@ internal discussions could come .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the United States .
oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with its investment program Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies and demand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should also be paid better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp wants to do on this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ attle , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is about to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics are holding him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , which at least wants to demand from the rich , is paying more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he glan@@ ces curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is a business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a support for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central shel@@ ters for all @-@ ti@@ pped women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her run , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women out@@ weigh other reasons for their escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honour mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north @-@ east of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodation just for them , challenged B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be accommodated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or become men and women together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
as much as the women feel this need , one can read the urge to reach the house in Munich .
&quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr said .
you could easily build a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work campaigns
assistant representatives have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that there would have been ministers to address the concerns regarding the contract .
physicians and medical students agreed in July about the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members that were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; to problems , leading to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC management agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Council today conven@@ ed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating labour action that begins at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that resident physicians pointed out six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A resident doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ av@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual terms that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 doctors and medical students that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin absor@@ bs his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ rower and hardly radi@@ ated , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was burnt down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger , as it was done by a supposedly boy@@ friend .
building up the ve@@ to becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia was able to win a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ceas@@ ef@@ ire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having dismissed almost his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television far@@ ed cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , as it considers its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin &apos;s sn@@ ail emp@@ ires is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for sure that , after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , he demanded support for the elected state institutions .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit at this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries which are rejected by the West and treated badly and now fade away .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents of the press conference testified that they did not even bother the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to under@@ line them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to back office roles .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambitions of the Bank .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced himself from collap@@ sing and rescu@@ ing almost collap@@ sed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange listing will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as to the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we do not pursue global targets , but rather local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own communities for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Mar@@ ches , for how do we focus internally ( we asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think there will be many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , which won him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner , D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that New@@ market happened because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori inv@@ ents the jubil@@ ation when he takes the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career victories
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have been enth@@ r@@ alled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he &apos;d already gotten 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big gymn@@ ast jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has suffered in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying F@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his skep@@ tics and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin &apos;s Prime Minister Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s close relationship of confidence for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special officer for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement from the Krem@@ lin it is said that without giving reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties had been arranged as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Regi@@ stra@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked me to leave his post and V@@ ain@@ o recommended his successor .
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends for a long time and works as he does for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is here the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official alleg@@ ation - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president at a time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - tru@@ sting for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term in Putin viol@@ ated the Constitution .
but this post was occupied by one of Putin &apos;s closest allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical dispute on the set of the series in Los Angeles , last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before announ@@ cing his termination .
on the set there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the Gib@@ son character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date according to the statement by ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played at the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been involved since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood inside the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will not be possible now .
I would like to thank the writers , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in Ban@@ ff &apos;s garden
a citizen of Ban@@ ff asked for help from the identification of the fish , who appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be Sand@@ a@@ ale for the 75 fish , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling bo@@ ars &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ski@@ ve ropes .
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic extent in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a ton for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project .
in this fantastic project the sh@@ utter is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing north tower deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the sides of the country .
this was achieved by pulling the northern tower bridge 700 mm south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity .
massive , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team works towards were tiny - on each side , they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert , after a crew observed the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved out of their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat moving around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the lif@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luckily the strong winds have blown the boat out of its reach , until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boun@@ cy without any life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ating engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded on the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today w@@ akes over these men .
seriously injured - man stands on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic cul@@ pri@@ t cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called on his mother .

together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old shr@@ ug@@ ged his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschwei@@ g. inexpensive flats ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future investors should be taken much more seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next session of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
first of all it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , in future 20 percent of all apartments must be equipped as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is as viol@@ as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to grow at least 10 percent in such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing construction program that will cost millions and still has to be financed is to provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few prescri@@ p@@ tions as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the left wants even harder runs for investors .
regardless of this , viol@@ a , there is an ag@@ gra@@ vation of the situation on the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet completely : because the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you balance the loss of further around 1300 affordable housing that will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 , it will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , as planned by the plann@@ er Nicole Palm , now running b@@ ind@@ ings from the city should be bought .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing back apartments back in price relationships .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back in price fixing for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the western city increases dr@@ astically , one distances itself from the goal of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few city districts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group CEO Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more sites for single @-@ family homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean that there is still a compromise to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens has been regre@@ t@@ ted by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games , and finally on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July .
market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand over@@ loaded by the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5.000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of consecutive people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people that look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game per@@ spir@@ ators who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track down our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , because of poker success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activities in the real world , helping many people hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ ine
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is im@@ mu@@ n on all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ra@@ ced on Thursday for a multi @-@ campaign title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ all@@ ist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the floating bar during the single multi @-@ campaign engagement of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title and , in total , the fifth , while she affir@@ ms her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has won the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on from her said she was &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as disappointment .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ camp in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insisted , during their long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last so long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was easily deceived by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ei@@ ving .
Swedish bar and ground floor - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she picked up 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating bar again - and on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man gently embra@@ ced her as she expected her end @-@ risk - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina went .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their floor exercises , she threw the audience out of the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning :
police : 3 victims shot in serial kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle liners , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ over@@ f@@ eit , since the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed and two others injured in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting inflic@@ ted on an empty truck @-@ truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with Micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most of the 6 year old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the fe@@ west of his age , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I did not create that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , you got involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know people still do &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up until his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund mentioned for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters on his own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the C@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I always asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , flooding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ dings in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ scale flooding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had demanded tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is deployed across large parts of south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers might flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stream @-@ headed flood in Ascension Par@@ ish poses a danger as they will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden Ri@@ vers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest state ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still kno@@ cked people out of the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed from the globe on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another boot @-@ boy who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and poured in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford .
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years she lived there , she never saw such a high level of river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members all had disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities should take into account ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer appeared near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inch rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lessons in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa inv@@ aded 200 houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded now .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven animals washed by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to flooding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and stores .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to have been reported as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday none were reported .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; blo@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown was suffering from multiple injuries , including in the lung , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was at the hospital in his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his small body was blown away by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t believe it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have begun the first class at a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was shot at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who is in a critical condition shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to different assault rif@@ les , sur@@ rendered the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is definitely a continuing fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were po@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have been several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police p@@ man Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and police are currently investigating the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ag@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers herself and the police still looks for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than a reason .
first of all I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three female dancers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflecting the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year we were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was che@@ ering a surprising number of Olympic med@@ als and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold in an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but we do not see gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are a cost@@ lier sports and gymn@@ asts primarily arise in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued as desired .
the majority of these turn@@ tables are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy accessible exercise exercise .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develop strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ time benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
resident doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 resident doctors who voted for a vote refused him .
in July Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS had found itself in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay for the staff and patients would be harmful .
the first resident doctors shall have a new contract , which includes changes to bed@@ time and weekend periods in order to improve the care of mat@@ ur@@ ation times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance , announced last night in a communication : &quot; assistance specialists have still serious concerns about the proposed agreement , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce and it will be able to treat all physicians . &quot;
in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks have spur@@ red on the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was what happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made until the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the worries of the resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do so , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in meeting doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week payment for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors , which are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , CEO of the N@@ HS staff , called on the assistance specialists to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour struggles are not just a little , but already pol@@ lu@@ te over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we discussed the committee of assistants and gave a positive answer to the concerns about the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other important subjects - such as deployment , flexibility during training , additional training for those who were returning from vocational training , training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health on compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
about 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form floor@@ ings .
when the t@@ opping breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack .
if the blood c@@ lot loos@@ ens , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft recommendation of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health technology evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness : political rect@@ ness gives rise to electoral fraud in Muslim neighbor@@ hoods
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a governmental report on corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political rect@@ ness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities ignor@@ ing how a devastating government report today is being exposed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , elec@@ tive observers , and town halls to ignore the evidence of abuse as a result of &quot; violations of eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral b@@ ins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes not to put removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their votes to prevent anyone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to congreg@@ ational documents and decisions on non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a Special Tribunal recommended that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be removed after a lit@@ any of corruption and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of an im@@ itation , in which a person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - when older members of the Muslim community made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leadership of ID cards to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as evidence , it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was applied , in particular women and young people , in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such behaviour would have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interference with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate brief@@ ings to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harvest harvest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for asylum and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask elec@@ torate before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of a person &apos;s nationality to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year restriction on applications for an automatic selection of letters .
prohibition of political activists to process full postal codes and envel@@ opes of postal elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers for election stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law which facilitates an indictment because of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photography in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule out the rule that voters go to the poll@@ ing booth alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was filed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral district has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corruption and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was ple@@ aded guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registers of the Town H@@ ouses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy about Kate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come across the French bike sports@@ woman Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , except the edge and band , which has proven to be an impressive double @-@ leg@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic ik@@ in is by far not the only athlete competing in gold , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe in the social media .
hon@@ ouring the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I &apos;m taking this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
a step higher : this user believes that Nathan is an athle@@ tic version of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut , who showed similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan has been att@@ ested by fans to match an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities .
theory placed in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user declared their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , broad smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese float &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Byr@@ on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s analysis about the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200 free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron revol@@ ts viewers of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ h games on Wednesday
the Canadian channel C@@ BC had to ap@@ olog@@ ise after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; went off &quot; like M@@ ief &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator Byr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200 free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald who was brought on board to the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited went down like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
audience in the whole of Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ mm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The C@@ BC comment@@ ator has just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t get that they were still on the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against Byr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was quick and hard , with which many were talking about him .
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ si@@ bly Byr@@ on Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly thereafter Scott Russ@@ el ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ ct via Twitter
Scott Russ@@ el &apos;s colleague , Scott Russ@@ el , had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to over 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
however , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . Byr@@ on does what he said very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic Games , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ regard intended and I am very sorry . &quot;

the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mark to try different under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
they continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tasted the under@@ pants before she put it back in the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rose and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , with@@ drew her own trousers and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they with@@ drew the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , attracted herself again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bo@@ thered by anyone observing - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take home under@@ pants with a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of sales after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t wash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Union in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer around for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when approaching from behind you should turn up first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the att@@ acker cro@@ aks from pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that at a rob@@ bery it is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you &apos;re a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right che@@ at for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and the lit@@ urgy of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k l@@ apped his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before sett@@ ling each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to let in .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to the light .
the thought of kn@@ itting the pur@@ ge of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the advancement of gut bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left that he le@@ aked out , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his gut by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public money to railway stations to flush washing of toilets , the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was definitely justified to his reputation .
the only thing he le@@ aned was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample cut showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of newly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ ance was more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of Mil@@ k products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I will not lick here anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Ci@@ vic President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we carried out crazy bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming that ended saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian when he checked out some of the things I had told him to leak , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents said lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of ga@@ stri@@ c and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they would at least occasionally use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung &apos;s social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she terr@@ orized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in irre@@ parable condition .
the walls were perfor@@ ating holes , wood plan@@ ks were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was s@@ me@@ ared on walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful as Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was a street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ kers and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were used in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up .
neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be inv@@ oked by the police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte it and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ons were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not talking about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been given the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were established at regular intervals , for 20 years
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown site of the community house
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step that considers Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .

workers of house management will now have to remove rub@@ b@@ ish mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police passed a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ffiti .
the police say they will navigate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the rules of the house
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without repro@@ ach and to those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic after flying a flying military jet beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal revi@@ ved the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force laid an incredible pl@@ unge
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety hazard existed
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet drops over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military airplane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokesman said that the jet caused a little deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the poor visibility of the area , but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk .
surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where there were also four people on the island of Madeira to death .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly as low as possible on the basis of circumstances - heavy fog and fire smoke - which limits his vision .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights for the first step towards the first title triumph in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the reg@@ ression increases three days later in Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ man has to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the rival Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing European League champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the demand for Bar@@ ca was at least clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo for the time being .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen comp@@ eted in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
so far , coach Luis En@@ rique has given up a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen is the winner in most of the remaining applications .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness state of the team , which was humili@@ ated in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday .
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ gress against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really know yet .
Sevilla , on the other hand , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with 11 successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma Long in an own league of table tennis @-@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - Chinese MA Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old sealed his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ sided final .
this brought the world @-@ ranking first to the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als tournament and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ pe@@ ani .
the two Chinese , as expected , made it into the final game and made themselves the title of each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top@@ most olymp@@ ic event was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they retired to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests alone in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the Mat@@ ches until here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said torture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the match gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight only in the first movement with his 28 year old opponent .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ macy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless sufficient breathtaking ballo@@ ons were to be seen .
Miz@@ pe@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had a ri@@ b injury , after that he had to settle in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .

Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states losing their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the previously republi@@ can strongh@@ old of Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having tos@@ sed 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , there is a doubt about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in key states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sh@@ elling .
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds sh@@ acks
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tru@@ mp in front but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp responded to the question as to stopping the Clin@@ to@@ on &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does not reach for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s all right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of living .
according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened to cancel funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey results .
instead of that , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to engage in the Congress more strongly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ est Sc@@ am at D@@ oping @-@ Test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately announced that it would promptly establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function reported that the former S@@ printer and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the D@@ oping Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and as F@@ erg@@ uson , I spent the rehear@@ sal and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i explained .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ uson Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan team leader Michael Rot@@ ich was withdrawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C following numerous dop@@ ing associations .
when the IO@@ C launched more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls in front of Rio Games , it was unusual to note that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia should be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency , before the summer games in Brazil , exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya started from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing combat is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeated over and over again that in Kenya D@@ oping resources are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
the IO@@ C member , Richard Po@@ und , recently called for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in the Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships .
it has been demonstrated that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically absorbed .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the help of a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth space .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musically exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and bright and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .

conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !

London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ t@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ t@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ t@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from east London went to a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been told that she has married an ISIS comb@@ at@@ ant in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said , Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in case of election victory in Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , during a telephone conference , Rei@@ d said that he would expect from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he wasn &apos;t talking to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge of the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID told re@@ public@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ per Workers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp .
he also stated that Donald Tru@@ mp was in@@ appropriate for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mers to release a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys differs because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that the calendar does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical naked where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the Cal@@ endar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person with open casting inv@@ itations in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors , who escape from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the hard action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the attempted coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president of the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ lication years ago , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sh@@ en@@ ched put@@ sch still saw secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that even receives refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chief of Staff compla@@ ined of the deliberate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to boost exit pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Association demanded that the German government be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition parties .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and secular , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; world . &quot;
as the newspaper reported by calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already presented the largest group of asylum seekers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and there@@ with almost 29 per cent of all as asylum seekers have been authorized to recognise ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey we do not find those who wage war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not vote for the parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
until 2021 the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land bal@@ dness - that bites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on the way to U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
to do this , practical problems come : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count on voices in the end , only work hard .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign over the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , you can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , spreading roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary wor@@ dy predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , se@@ ering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel makes blame on Af@@ D &apos;s flour@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary election circuit is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s no shame for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual electoral campaigns on market@@ places and in front of m@@ alls with suns@@ ha@@ des and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , co@@ ca@@ ine thinks , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country you crum@@ ble the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er co@@ ke to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in the opinion p@@ olls , the Social Democrats last stood behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only margin@@ ally before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD gained a clear victory of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should make the leap into the country &apos;s parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the vac@@ ations and place their campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green election warri@@ ors go on search for local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ t with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ castles and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is re@@ formed .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; they made it all rather jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the opposite will also be praised by those responsible for the construction works , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fan@@ dingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is over again , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now sail from O@@ don@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Head Office Manager Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ stitutes , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ field had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping roads were seeking and rather familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ised .
because even the speed limits were not met , the congregation reinforced the measuring vehicle of M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceed@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed on the spot himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been heated .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has gone further , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers coming from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales qu@@ arri@@ es allows anyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the search engine is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most strongly depl@@ eted are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly kr@@ one , finds clear words .
that is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is deci@@ ph@@ ering sales revenue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renovation was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , answered with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all the complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you cannot go down , it is also very nice elsewhere .
the fact that his family climate is coming back after the renovation works has no doubt about this .
despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
it is constantly being scre@@ wed to laws in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks , interior minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a large security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what does a Dul@@ ce status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas De Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they demand no one .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior he was placed on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had a little time to pass before he presented his conclusions on the security of the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , filed : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cr@@ ushing of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and tru@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt to make proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ cking jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man conce@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this unacceptable and also demands nothing that any chances for the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they are in part in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should let their smartphones check their smartphones and social media accounts for a security check .
in case of Dul@@ tas for expi@@ red asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about such crimes that commit crimes or throw their papers consciously in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
some of them are still un@@ exploited and are open to questions .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , say de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in the face of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that pro@@ found@@ ly workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not let themselves stap@@ le even in election campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal security has enormously moved into focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are cont@@ ests .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , the two parties went high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only a gar@@ dener dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy @-@ political collection of some interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demanded a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here to make conci@@ li@@ atory notes .
he has nothing of a return from a double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have paci@@ fied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to re@@ do it is not expe@@ dient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections in case of a bur@@ ka ban .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a lot in it , which could cause quar@@ rels .
but even the SPD is trying to make a profile of internal security at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; chief leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel clearly sign@@ aled cau@@ ti@@ ously , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , delivery volumes are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the recall campaign there is confusion about a term .
Volkswagen launches in the second half of the year when deliveries are delivered .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand was weak@@ ening particularly in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales , as announced in the Da@@ x company .
globally , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year .
in the home market Germany the deliveries fell by almost a sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a reluct@@ ance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhau@@ sts first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected family brand of the Lower Saxony is already getting off lightly by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is accounted for .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further show sales spl@@ its from January to July .
in this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had rig@@ ged with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW conf@@ essed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer provides a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after retro@@ fitting , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now granted its German customers a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed Volkswagen &apos;s representative in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA in full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the warranty that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power do not take place after the retro@@ fitting and all type appro@@ vals relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; means that customers can come to a workshop for example half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the scandal , to an uncertainty on possible warranty claims , as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Volkswagen does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires wealthy econom@@ ists in the future - as a second institute in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on checking or daily accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euro are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 people will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs continue .
letting the cash flow in the treas@@ ury of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the board administrator .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavarian association association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically un@@ sustainable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with penalty interest for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , but the competition in Germany is much too strong under banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that &apos;s equipped with a bit more lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it hats costs for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no other banks known to charge a compensation for in@@ soles of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ aker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ ban@@ ken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ ban@@ ken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , announced at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and there is a threat to the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not like that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love records .
before sharing the comment section , to s@@ lit@@ te under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ g@@ atory Men &apos;s Middle @-@ Ages with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the pre@@ valence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als , which want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ No@@ stal@@ gie .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ bies - it has an emotional meaning : older plate buyers are more likely to retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wear a modest grey suit and lo@@ osen wild@@ ly before I stay , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in direct proximity to various men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re @-@ buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my charge .
WE@@ Z , 25 working with Si@@ ster Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records .
from the conversations I conducted , people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to followers of the plate re@@ vis@@ ing of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar ba@@ ffle sleeves , from objects that watch happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a sort of consol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff member fli@@ ckers from a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I fl@@ atten through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead ba@@ ffle so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ rich .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who first come in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ opp , dedicated almost all the way to the records , has a colourful audience when I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ble and sexually @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks odd , but the mental trauma is hard to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates to be sold .
it looks more like a shopping window than a big shopping mall .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she dri@@ fts away with a loving si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to muster the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id Cam@@ eras , before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that spends most of the luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are ignored , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collector &apos;s female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they will certainly not spend their Thursday morning by stro@@ lling through the stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they steer clear of the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator that stands above the shoulders of unaware of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which individuals within the camp offer goods , from cigarettes to erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which contained a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais are &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is non@@ profit and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle @-@ bearing living has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympics disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ appointing appearance in the Olympic season , cyclists Tony Martin won &apos;t want to be defeated .
&quot; I keep watching the World Cup in view , remain confident and fight on , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he doesn &apos;t have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the time @-@ run of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace what causes would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are being tested , which are to over@@ run the tem@@ pos@@ als very effectively .
the futur@@ istic en@@ closures tra@@ ilers of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary speed limit to ensure compliance with the speed limit .
however , a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days during un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access prohibited by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved with any car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way disappear also sh@@ ush@@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic &apos;s data in various federal states and is now also being used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year .
UK gets silver in 7 @-@ Series Ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji meets Master@@ class gold
the Great Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the de@@ odor@@ o stage in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fiji had a master class in handling , side qu@@ il@@ ting , back shifting , line running , and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - the fourth one on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji had struck a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it might be a comfort for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under Ryan they lost each game to the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lost one thing .
this stage is going to hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks left off fun .
it felt like captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running in driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 up when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ra@@ ced in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
a rival T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain from Man@@ Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but Fiji just stopped .
in the seventh minute , Am@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ova went to the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ plu@@ mage and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ cl@@ ings of the GB team and r@@ ushed to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 while GB is still being taught .
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea Sul@@ phi@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags , and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and G@@ GB cr@@ ammed cr@@ ushing into the grass .
in the past , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ als from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown pushed the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a goal under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no more em@@ ur@@ inal gold than these games , and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning had an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present when she moved to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who set such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9th un@@ cann@@ y deployment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph to ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was no one more assistant than the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he would ever survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that was oper@@ able and they did that .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the correct term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go back better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ induc@@ ing morning to talk about something more than usual , trying to process his own an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . this might be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thanks goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to make something great .
today we didn &apos;t want fireworks , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity taken care of
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ use band@@ age as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original one in a post by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the ken@@ nel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; applies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , of which 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the freshwater fitness association of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , Breit@@ brunn , supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 locations and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ tah .
water supply contracts are available for further cities and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his duties have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work to office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added novel@@ ties because water is life and drinking water is the most important food@@ stuff .
in her lau@@ dat@@ ory she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faith@@ fully , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived in real life as a water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ r@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate sin@@ king before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised the water @-@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as high points from his point of view he described the well construction and restructuring of the ken@@ nel .
but the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est use were the pipe break@@ age at the church no@@ isi@@ er on 3 January .
at minus 17 degrees it was necessary to work throughout the night so that the towns could be supplied with water .
the supply of new brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko talks openly about the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
but the meanwhile eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago has come forward well and is now studying at home in New York where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : when I ask him something , which is two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shooting for Life Haz@@ ards
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on his partner and wounded her fat@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called on us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be publicly punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ baked and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. should call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship laminate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially wanted to make no indications of the trial or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but she confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deli@@ ri@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special task force ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of action .
steel - Licht@@ blick for Germany &apos;s steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants of the so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ CC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said to the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , f@@ alle an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for the production of its own electricity .
in this way , the status quo of the previous scheme is largely fixed .
the successful efforts made by Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions law , climate and employment targets are weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation was further ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw large steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers t@@ oss price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have accumulated .
it is unclear how sustainable the price is .
the German industry prim@@ us Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also wanted to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite increasing prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the requested quantity went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Magi@@ st@@ erium studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Seni@@ oren@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has also made this experience in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to approach and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly ask their lungs will not be able to get out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life too quickly .
even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors &quot; Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people ev@@ okes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers de@@ think of long @-@ lying events .
in singing , a special performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time , concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone are not just concentrating on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
Hi , of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blo@@ gging . thanks .
if someone comes from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one simply can join .
many cities also offer views of the cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly .
many people &apos;s cho@@ irs can also be found on the internet .
those who have no access to the internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males to scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the sleep of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the Mi@@ str@@ ust also didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved like the females in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ain@@ ing of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ ds of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists discovered by the Veter@@ inary College and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
cat also responds to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed juven@@ iles for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are distinguished by the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a small sample of babies taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
despite the small sample for meaningful results , the researchers hold their results .
&quot; all the females , even those who still had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned faster to the speaker when this calls was played out of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males did not react at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist told Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted coup attempt in Turkey an important football game takes place again .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul at the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was suspended after the fall arrest in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , even before football is not stopped .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors issued an arrest warrant against the former Str@@ ong Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r .
accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ g is to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency endu@@ red for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has as good as no impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the President &apos;s friends .
but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , the harsh opposition of the Turks is the strict rejection of military coup .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy , Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will arrive in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also rose early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year &apos;s year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season clas@@ ps as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ tex @-@ ö@@ nig gave the basis for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez rented to Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the attempted coup attempt failed to return for the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; if Mario , however , wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man cited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated 7.5 million euros estimated , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the theme of dop@@ ing still determines the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about the games after a D@@ oping ban shortly before the games , was fl@@ atten@@ ed and ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a strange scene : with a raised smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her performance .
when it was clear that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm storm .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion in 2010 had to reti@@ re a six month lock after having been detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don pain .
after a surgery she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship was tested positive on the forbidden stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the know@@ ingly taking and was locked six months later .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold@@ fin@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and 21 months have been frozen .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly an athlete got so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
in 2004 , the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to hand over to the 2004 Olympic Games because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European Championships in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record holder and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion found evidence of taking a forbidden health supplement , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and expi@@ red on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ horror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered from wounds and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left this .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as dum@@ b .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , where two bombs explo@@ ded on Thursday evening .
according to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives were fired again , and another human being killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong which was popular during holidays .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a municipal cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flo@@ wery before the territory of the coast police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called for several injuries .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before re@@ porters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist insurrection movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities would have been receiving secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police told their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they do not judge tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and the population of the population , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , would benefit himself from having restored the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the ri@@ p@@ pling revolt of Muslim rebels for years in the ou@@ ter@@ most south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
nearly one year ago , 20 people were killed at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several coun@@ tri@@ dges , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Federal Government have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &apos; Identi@@ ty movement &apos; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Prime Minister Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ und@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how immigrants differ in extrem@@ ist ways from Islamic faith or the Middle East .
that is why we are now observing the movement too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it applies to &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identifying &quot; already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ e said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices when it was decided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts are generally trying to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising promotion for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
eating Ma@@ e said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals , who are extrem@@ ist , and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the marked increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees &apos; homes , Ma@@ ee@@ h said he would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be rights @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present groups were created at the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ma@@ as expressed concern that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who had previously not appeared in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always the deciding factor in the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weigh@@ ted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia went so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a 48 @-@ second reg@@ ression and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 runners .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special starting right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries better known .
as most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English bou@@ levard &quot; The Sun &quot; made it funny with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; based on a &quot; prosperity bar . &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney .
the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ atorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete in a race over 100 meters of free style alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was then fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

accidents - Bus non@@ slip in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight Ver@@ ents
in an accident of a touring coach with 43 senior passengers as passengers , eight people were injured in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( County Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade an opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite road .
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident at the provincial road 2 .
the unexpected travellers were brought back to the town of Pe@@ w@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the tra@@ ilers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of sewage will amount to 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage treatment plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 ; for Zul@@ te berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate measures for improvement are needed .
after a precip@@ it@@ ous calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the County Council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover for these sewage installations .
due to legal principles , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ effective manner .
as of 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ te berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated .
Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect .
in addition , wastewater output in all three systems is slightly declining .
in the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation period in all three plants , renovation and repair expenses have fallen in a considerable scope , not least because of their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ te berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of after almost 20 years . the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came to bear the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that with the small waste of sewage in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; sm@@ ashed . &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long term , especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal is not possible to expand these facilities because it concerns public defic@@ its .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July amounted to 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furnishings , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; -@@ effect critici@@ zed as an Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filtering tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ infl@@ amed , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all defects will come to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past when they were bl@@ amed that the app would propag@@ ate Black@@ face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blown che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wondered if this repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company provided an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter reminded of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the Ani@@ me comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and bad . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osi@@ tion of a very disgu@@ sting Asian cartoon and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ bearing , but that the yellow @-@ face was pulled into the turning extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company to cross this cultural tunnel .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ chat &apos;s large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things will go un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that rapid controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ i @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its staff , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on sub @-@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said that she will close her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence information , re@@ jects con@@ gres@@ sional committee
military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground , an inquiry committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Armed Forces Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Budget Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction with Central Command &apos;s secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically inspired by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government sp@@ ik@@ es under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comment@@ aries and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; reported the report .
for example , a Cent@@ com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts worried about manipul@@ ating reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com Reports are underway through the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the high @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Represent@@ atives , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preached the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the demo@@ crats stated that they found no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress &apos;s investigations were published Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who had been taken up after complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokesman of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress , while the inspec@@ tors of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have further re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
the alleg@@ ations of last year have raised the question , however , that President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that , contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this finding was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com &apos;s condem@@ nation , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for its exc@@ essively positive assessment of the military situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the US win four matches in the hockey of the women , show@@ down a show@@ down with Britain
one day after firing three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember having ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will conver@@ ge on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer for the strong Dut@@ ch@@ men to lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a hockey ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to turn things into a better place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London we now have .
we have completely destroyed the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a revers@@ al from the close range .
India was going to play without a win in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the U.@@ S.A. door guard , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a door in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympics , the Zen of the Tramp@@ oline
wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympics are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and unavoid@@ able , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the Cross@@ bow to a float to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dim@@ ples , could certainly have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , built up by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic gymn@@ asts .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event equal .
further from the centre , partly in the shade there are sports , which are not generally accepted : aerial pi@@ sto@@ l shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast swimming and may rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my particular favorite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so spar@@ sely noticed that many who I had asked did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 an athlete , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it suits the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ erous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially combines it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ bo@@ under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rising conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympics program , they are evaluated according to execution , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio .
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold continue to go faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the original wall , but also another high goal in the television transmission : that of the world or the Olympic Port .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I personally feel when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back upwards .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolf in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon , in the streaming by 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13 : 00 pm .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male US @-@ Tur@@ ner proposed recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to rin@@ se , new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testified that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police on shooting .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people r@@ ushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ essly .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the videos circul@@ ating about the protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to take a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Commission now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is Nigeria &apos;s most popul@@ ous country and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the country &apos;s opposition has been limited , whereas dissi@@ dents have been effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and don &apos;t have any other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a professor in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
after a far @-@ critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time tensions along the border to Erit@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years , can exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess explo@@ de after years of taking turns under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they gathered so much protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from A@@ th@@ op@@ i@@ ens predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in coordin@@ ating under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who account for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence , trade and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Minister of Ethiopia for sevent@@ een years until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern e@@ thiop@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands prot@@ ested against elections which , according to the statements of analysts , apparently had been pla@@ stered by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , like the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal dis@@ assembly of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , led by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim to have ISIS established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication brought new questions to the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its fellow campaig@@ ners who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp made his way back to the alleg@@ ation on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism ki@@ cks off on Mr. Tru@@ mp while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling fra@@ ctions .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later on , &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic borders in politics and then back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp assumed an even more et@@ ching tone as his survey scores declined further .
a recent pol@@ l by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp generally tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he emphas@@ ises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s j@@ okes have brought his loyal companion into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s testimony whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama is an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back @-@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong , and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
the majority of the mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed ISIS to expand by subj@@ ecting them to control the situation in the Middle East .
before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of moving around on each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a well @-@ known café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay cash , no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people scre@@ wed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ile wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and verb is now a soap business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also a re @-@ invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ishing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she gave up coffee drinking for a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was about coffee and culture in the club that pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new additive .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and faithful customer .
he went there in front of the work and inv@@ ari@@ ably always ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap shop occupied the old business room .
in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie tried to create a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to put them out soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to bottle and sell the cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to an adjacent building .
for many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the locom@@ otive and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and both are food historians .
CO@@ Es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while bricks in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; were told about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear at Har@@ per Verlag on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , cold snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929 .
brick , 54 , made a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered h@@ ack@@ ers , this found the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretched the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and freshly baked p@@ ate served for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the land was going to be no longer the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods that recy@@ cle K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ pairing food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; bri@@ gh@@ tening up as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury .
strange mix@@ tures have been tried , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction takes preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
while researching the book , which also includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
as never before or since , domestic econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - drove the country &apos;s eating habits like such .
by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household @-@ politi@@ cans , &quot; and the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to the star@@ ving citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake Food attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ it like the millions @-@ strong man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
perhaps President Roosevelt would have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have prompted him to embar@@ k on an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt made that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression manage to deal with food has been dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country got back on its feet .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ shake @-@ inf@@ est@@ ation .
after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e ev@@ oke a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Roosevelt would eat at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a usual trick to give modest names to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody showed a reluct@@ ance to take a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took a supplement three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a group of civilians who according to Bild @-@ Zeitung had saved almost 60,000 lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life into play to draw people out of bom@@ bed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civilian shiel@@ ding who shows him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has never seen himself as a hero , but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me it &apos;s the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bombs of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually only comes to the surface in winter .
after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland ha@@ ie will only get up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a rich 2.@@ 6@@ km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle dominated by slow@@ ness seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case by a Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ bare of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock explains this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks will become rock @-@ old .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees cen@@ tig@@ rade , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland .
their slow motion measured them , when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks still make prey : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ rent from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens kernel of sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already occurs before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons @-@ seeking increased quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of 220 centimet@@ res length of the third smallest animal , the core of the l@@ enti@@ cular nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their liner @-@ core , which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 cm for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter @-@ long Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only then get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ arks with the increase obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year old Greenland @-@ whale , in its bac@@ on at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip stuck , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flames .
they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals often become particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat from one gram of mouse is much greater than that of one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ bare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , a very large animal should invest its resources more into a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics related to construction , the municipal council has focused on the most recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , plot and closure issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be found , the sale of land plots in residential areas &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) for interested parties is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors equally .
as it was said , construction permits can now be reported in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting .
in order to also establish requests for sett@@ ling further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
the commercial area , which has already been designated there , is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances of reloc@@ ating from London to jobs and companies in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary aggregates can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is far enough for them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they just use large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , because they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , but as much as Dublin does worse in the infrastructure .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
in addition , the city boasts an easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of corporate advice Mer@@ cer the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial hub for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers .
at the end of 2015 , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbur@@ se the legal costs incurred in the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was set free of a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US Ambassador to Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir lays the ground@@ work , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops backed by the United States say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the United States supported the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokesman for the group said on Friday .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( CS@@ TO ) are being comb@@ ated after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council , allied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are doing just clearing up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reuters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published its tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the demo@@ crats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , chief@@ ly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a blat@@ ant contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ pul@@ sions in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter regarding the publication of the Democratic candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s Special Ad@@ vis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to release something before the tax examinations were not finished .
among other things , Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal questions regarding wealth , his donations for charitable organizations , his business shares and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp aff@@ or@@ ded his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke about the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co has reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this is still the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , tru@@ mp for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit by the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ci@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fireworks promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going inhabited by humans - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ d .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion along with the U.S. natural protection by working volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World Rally Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , keeping the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps involve lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the spark plug .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust into the air .
a touch quite usually already exp@@ els to hunt the elephant .
one last possibility is a thro@@ wer , who shoots a piece of gold into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
town coun@@ cill@@ or unanim@@ ously appro@@ ves : no ki@@ osk on the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the city coun@@ cill@@ or , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales tank at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine em@@ bank@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner &apos;s hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media uprising after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab guests were &quot; challenged &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of countries of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
there is no need to explain this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response from the internet , in which people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article indicating that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
adds that the country code has now been added .
police relies on tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reform for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to gr@@ ind the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the proposals by the governor of the federal state of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of the prot@@ esters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were spra@@ yed against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ se on walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recent protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian enterprises on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading up@@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian representation abroad issued approximately 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beverage market &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wald@@ br@@ öl &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rob@@ bery @-@ raid was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had wor@@ shi@@ ped their faces , ordered the issu@@ ance of cash from the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured , the police do not share with them .
the offen@@ ders should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpetrators must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and from the gravel parking space located in front of the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have been informed about the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) who are in connection with the rob@@ bery should urgently notify the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near mill .
in the quietly situated Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ ald , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to b@@ assist with the visit of the stro@@ king zoo .
to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ king .
for culinary purposes , children and car@@ ers with their own home @-@ made body@@ work such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones was created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sun and the children and young people returned home on the day of the voyage home .
shar@@ k loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were met together .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the minist@@ erial circular St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different pilgrimage targets have been tested and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a particular pilgrimage goal was offered at the St. Petersburg Cathedral .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , went their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster .
the single day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is continued to sing along field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m &apos;s booklet .
the past@@ ors of the local parish were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller arranged for a tasty and star@@ ving dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first we had to drop some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a barbecue at the pool@@ side in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed .
the min@@ is of co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold won gold
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . the J@@ enny made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he stor@@ med home to capture a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick once they took a modest sixth place at the London Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in good time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom she stayed , when she saw potential in the Scot@@ sman , which has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won an Olympic champion in the qualification laps , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which execution moved in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all sk@@ inners to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they climbed to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the victory in 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , he admitted that after a weak start he dropped off on the train .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a superb win this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the last three months .
with so many world titles we got so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of cycle .
with the form Kenn@@ y it &apos;s in the realm of possibility that he won Ho@@ ys winning three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int he starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification yesterday when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong railway steering team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a band of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the resignation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical director in April in the middle of sex and bul@@ b alleg@@ ations as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melting plant of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to plant the plant .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old subsi@@ dy exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the installation of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melt down consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last but not least because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expecting a dis@@ mis@@ sal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capability ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt is not impaired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn due to the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land mel@@ tdown in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to statements by analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts per year to generate around 900 meg@@ a@@ wat@@ ts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , watched reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é episode of almost every birthday party of a child &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ ne brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris was forced to take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself .
the September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover stars is eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the journal will se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true of Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ les of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community Centr@@ es assign 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s most common bed@@ dings are rejected annually by the community law centers , while the industry faces the effects of further mid @-@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been fully util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l community centre said that the last survey of the National Union of Community Govern@@ ors revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the resolution of the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community law centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families going through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of a legal way and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister as well as sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these mi@@ dd@@ le@@ ties so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community meeting centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp Leg@@ ged after employee supposedly weapon
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after being informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina had shot a gun on one employee in February while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed in the Charlotte Regional Court on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months to regulate the matter internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign director , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moved a pi@@ sto@@ l , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the race in Vincent &apos;s knees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was indic@@ ted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment only arrives two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and tru@@ ckers - should take action if his rival should be H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of due diligence and of Philip for bodily injuries and lasting mental harm . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before Land elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are drawing off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , while the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not represent 3 percent of the country &apos;s parliament in each case .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it thus still stands behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 per cent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ uties .

Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow @-@ motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies of high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Büro im West@@ er@@ asch@@ en@@ grav@@ ure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could receive a lot for those standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax , the Communic@@ ator was able to reach .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smart phone era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone thri@@ ll experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by suppliers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
to be online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
the company generated sales of 49 billion euros in 2014 . * Its operations are divided into four business sectors : mobility Solutions , Industrial Technology , Consumer Goods , and Energy and Building Technology .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet @-@ communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use .
the triumph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England has to direct the Olympic spirit and wi@@ den He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity all over the country not only in our local communities , but throughout the whole country .
for me this was the biggest attraction in He@@ a@@ throw , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a big effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will do this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and firms close to He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will already have 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ aps is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single one infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion of fun growth and bequ@@ eath a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
London &apos;s games from 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; regarding ad block@@ age
for companies who earn money with online advertising , one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ ade , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block scor@@ ing on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect the detection , which part of the site advertising is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the all@@ ying open source community and the swit@@ chers has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered into the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
according to a study conducted last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebook .
the company has made it clear to ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for social networking and inst@@ ag@@ ram shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs gives a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that new filters would cause new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook speaker in an e @-@ mail message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we have instead focused on Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman at presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call on witnesses , after a woman was killed in the early morning hours on Thursday during a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was lying in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was killed by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inves@@ tigation ( TV )
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them and every witness of the incident asking to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter informed the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosecutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where a person in the dark ran on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a police officer of the neg@@ ligent kidn@@ apping was acqu@@ itted after having beaten and killed a man who died on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; perfectly exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate models : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have recorded er@@ d@@ similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have pointed out beforehand that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still sp@@ un slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun shining 30 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow change of Venus is exposed to her daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is the average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously suspected of planetary scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
her oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and her water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che Trainer
Patrick Roy retired on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Neuro@@ an@@ che and led a too low co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado 88@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy commented in a statement .
in the course of the summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination with decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored as the best trainer in the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the post@@ season .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot at the Western Conference by five points .
when Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ v workers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remuneration for North sea oil workers are being exposed , while all parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil @-@ Field Service Provider Wood Group were carried spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of dra@@ fting the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop a few day @-@ to @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , beginning next year to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rate to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore sub@@ contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ swing .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had increased by the British ruling in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the red formation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Tel@@ esc@@ ope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete range of rot@@ ational rates below the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to the creation of planets .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the Ple@@ j@@ aden lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the quick@@ est .
at peak @-@ rotation rates , these mature stars meet large amounts of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slow down pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; at the Ple@@ j@@ aden Ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; says Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars , their rotation rates slow down and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail their latest analysis of the web press of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional resignation publication , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
he signed his signature under a ten @-@ year contract worth 27 million US dollars every year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will work as a consultant and a youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 counts for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have forbidden stero@@ ids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ Genesis Sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received powerful funding for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back in time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are also not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends have received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and given the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ du@@ alen Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio should not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an acquired athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athletes cont@@ ests these messages come to an end .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association is taking the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires full cooperation in the investigation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer responsible , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the rehabilitation of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it should act in the forbidden substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ specimen will have already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v informed the athlete immediately with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ bearing nation may not participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow to the reputation of the overall sport .
the world association IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the runners in Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the past off@@ springs in China were also cat@@ ered for fierce disputes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to be handed over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of an exploration of Australia &apos;s M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had been positively tested by the Chinese Championships on the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ one Stim@@ ul@@ ator , but had to reti@@ re only a three month lock .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching an app@@ alling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb &apos;s chief Mar@@ cin Kas@@ my@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Program@@ s were still designed to send commerci@@ als .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was alar@@ ming in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ jack .
in order to get the final code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stopp@@ ages .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 per cent of the German companies affected reported turnover losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of acts of illness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ tw@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to bar@@ gain in part and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
considering the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the job , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware in one week . &quot;
it is more likely , however , that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers only sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual black@@ mail .
the so @-@ called malware kits have been created by buying the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ jack then searches for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment will be made on an infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals instruc@@ t sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known for many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ yte survey focus on being able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assessment , the offen@@ ders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb &apos;s chief Mar@@ cin Kas@@ my@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetrators would also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V has only 1.@@ 60 m high , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the interior materials are well @-@ processed and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit of the cockpit is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with inver@@ ted and 10@@ 26 l in the back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ ks and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 metres high from the floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V with a torque of up to 300 Nm in large numbers of revolutions .
however , he is likely to do his job a bit qui@@ eter .
the average daily consumption is 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
another engine is available : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( operates at speeds of up to 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because when manoeu@@ v@@ ring , it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed train re@@ acts to the recognition of traffic signs and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed if required .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI bus@@ hing are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines meet Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable for the hazards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee line in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay damages to the man .
illness : when to pay the organizer
after their journey , they only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case a family was severely ill on the second day of their arrival .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it just before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially in the samples of water no contamination has been found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been concerned about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and decided at the same time to react to terrorism .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , however , this would increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère seeks to implement the proposals through the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium four @-@ digit scale over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
advocate of sympathy for terrorism must be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the use of weapons will be improved so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed tail of silence for doctors is supposed to be preserved in the words of de Ma@@ izi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession how to reduce the danger of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , taking a look at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister clearly spoke out against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be problematic for constitutional law .
you cannot prohi@@ bit everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
green Chief Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay do not bring people in this country more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but that is to change : the right @-@ wing bi@@ dding is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams if they drive over the motorway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 of August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße .
drivers can then directly hand in from the Hammer Road .
the major advantage : traffic is divided early so that the overall sequence is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea of the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder acceler@@ ates drivers particularly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle @-@ hole on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is directed only in a single lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back over three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary bearing capacity , in order to record the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated daily traffic jam will last , the competent provincial service cannot say .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the right @-@ to @-@ hand basin , the country has deliberately chosen the less traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays , because there are people with disabilities .
traffic will be guided on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy &apos;s theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the staging in the little house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit the cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most youngsters of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the boy &apos;s theatre Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ y , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to take part .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on the night for Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night had been bad for clouds and rain to watch the heavenly spectacle , said the chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they apparently come from the Per@@ se@@ us con@@ stellation , which is rising in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one is w@@ aking around forever ; at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not long before the alarm bells no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as non @-@ re@@ covering .
how can sleep problems manifest or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasized by Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you generally understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ing and sleeping disorder .
especially the sleeping feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practical experience in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind these can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
not in@@ frequently , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of a different disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially for depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors necess@@ itate each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two or three hours and possibly start to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment may look different : one is beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hardly any occupational therapists in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , in case of sleep problems , one should first contact the family doctor , he advises .
this can be clari@@ fied by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory drop@@ outs , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a disorder distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after baking , you go to bed at a normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping person .
how can people get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a number of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he was awarded gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premi@@ ums and a jungle king € 150@@ ,000 should not be surprised by missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see or even operate with dop@@ ing on the subject dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is the way you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot control a certain time before the WC / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demanded the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : arrest of baggage ti@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , civilians were arrested by two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock civilian officials in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf once again recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past th@@ ef@@ ts .
the two women and two men had multiple del@@ ik@@ es since the middle of July and were in a community , collaborative and especially professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves , who had been sent to Germany for the purpose of in@@ stit@@ uting criminal off@@ ences .
they captured a total of more than 15,000 euros .
the Rig@@ a@@ er Strasse in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem like this , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walking along the road from east to west , one passes to play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demol@@ ished soon , is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the premises on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers were cleared , pat@@ rolling the police for three weeks with official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocking parts of the road and refra@@ ined visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers moved under the che@@ wing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for walks with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late i .
there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
left force is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , are gener@@ ously anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the care of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to call for police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating lef@@ ti@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police force between the house occup@@ ants and their neighbors , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
also house staff@@ s and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic , among them almost the entire Mainz street near the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Mainz Navy had been put in a ver@@ itable street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly magn@@ ets for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them in qu@@ aked discs or newly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences , such as bodily injuries , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the criminal off@@ enses are property damage , which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is important : the 94 people in the 94 are their neighbours , they are not sure .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the R@@ ī@@ ga street - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from police , politics and media , which in July all were suddenly claiming the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings that supp@@ ress the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually fre@@ ehold flats , which are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well @-@ dressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you want to do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for drawn @-@ out people who are angry about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood .
those who are moving should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ bach : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a new commission@@ er for refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the asylum seek@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ laying Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , who primarily has a problem .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking but rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
the search was carried out with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , giving a lifel@@ ong Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administration work is not its central area , meaning Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organising , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honorary and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new containers are soon left in the washing line &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own rented living rooms .
the municipalities themselves must bear the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
the responsibility changes from the District council office to the municipality and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work so far , so it is dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community dwell@@ ings need to be re@@ plen@@ ished , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do charitable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean labour .
the day needs a solid structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so we need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here are the administration and volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach may not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there is also problem cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces afraid of radi@@ cal@@ isation , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ vely name may be called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also the subject of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would completely inv@@ ade them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so chief and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself .
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the old people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : search for bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly forced into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the de@@ forest@@ ation .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , wore both Blue@@ beard and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
at the same time , the police deployed several squ@@ ads and a police helicopter .
the settlement went without success .
perhaps the unknown came close to the apartment or when they were fle@@ eing .
