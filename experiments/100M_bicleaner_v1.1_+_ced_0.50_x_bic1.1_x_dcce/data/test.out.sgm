<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump want." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US Presidential candidates are in a fundamental issue, however, in tax and energy policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are underlying philosophical differences.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep this in doubt rather small and cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with tax and regulation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be entirely different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will speed up regulation and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why the taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In those that must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">Government investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical teapegoat wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">On Trump, therefore, party-internal discussions could come.</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to terminate the Parisian climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "with its investment program Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies and demand:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "they should also be paid better," "" "says Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do on this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rattle, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is about to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are holding him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, which at least wants to demand from the rich, is paying more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby with a maximum of one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is a business director of Condrobs, a support for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentral shelters for all-tipped women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">Women outweigh other reasons for their escape: "many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honour morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "that tugs for example demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps are often considered inferior and at worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north-east of Munich are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not voluntary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodation just for them, challenged Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District Governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Lower Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children in some community shelters.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "also calls for women to be separated from men." ""</seg>

<seg id="46">Especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">As much as the women feel this need, one can read the urge to reach the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and declare an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin absorbs his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrower and hardly radiated, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke repeatedly of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "Moscow's reaction to the time was burnt down." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to fall into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger, as it was done by a supposedly boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the veto becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having dismissed almost his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television fared cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempt to take power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin's snail empires is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for sure that, after the attempted coup d "état, he demanded support for the elected state institutions.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit at this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries which are rejected by the West and treated badly and now fade away.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents of the press conference testified that they did not even bother the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to underline them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin's Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's close relationship of confidence for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special officer for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement from the Kremlin it is said that without giving reasons," "" "the release Ivanovs of his duties had been arranged as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanovs since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Registrar.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state concerning bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked me to leave his post and Vaino recommended his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends for a long time and works as he does for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official allegation - that a man who once was touted as a potential president at a time would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - trusting for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term of office Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term in Putin violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was occupied by one of Putin's closest allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling boars" "", "which approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 skive ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The €1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineering art from a truly epic extent in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is given a ton for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first closure is a major milestone in each bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the shutter is a forward-looking high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the existing north tower deck, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern tower bridge 700 mm south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs around 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards by about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team works towards were tiny - on each side, they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer allowed to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens has been regretted by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games, and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand overloaded by the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go has more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person returns every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35.000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of consecutive people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people that look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumpy game perspirators who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track down our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of poker success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with activities in the real world, helping many people hunt, active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="17">She expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake at Mustafina went.</seg>

<seg id="32">After their floor exercises, she threw the audience out of the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine among the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three female dancers, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflecting the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year we were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was cheering a surprising number of Olympic medals and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but we do not see gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are a costlier sports and gymnasts primarily arise in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turntables are in prosperous suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities aun countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy accessible exercise exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-time benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team, which brings thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by the Holen of the Olympic team and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per day medicine after being advised by the authorities to administer more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or other heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE regulation authority has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">About 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls that form floorings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the topping breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot causing blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">If the blood clot loosens, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft recommendation of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "when approaching from behind you should turn up first, so that you can see your attacker and" "" "go out of the line" "", "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee in the lath and twist while the attacker croaks from pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun, grab the gun and twist it so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright cheat for a travel guide his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and the liturgy of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk lapped his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before settling each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to let in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to the light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of knitting the purge of a pull toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the advancement of gut bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left that he leaked out, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his gut by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to railway stations to flush washing of toilets, the task assigned its immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely justified to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he leaned was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample cut showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometry number of newly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their luminance was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of Milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have gerocked in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here anything here, because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valio Senior Civic President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at while explaining the benefits of probiotics at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we carried out crazy brainstorming that ended saying" "" "Let's call us Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday surroundings, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I lost my respect for Ian when he checked out some of the things I had told him to leak, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015 84 percent of all respondents said lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of gastric and intestine and 58 percent said that they would at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asoziale family left her social housing after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000 because she terrorized her neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were perforating holes, wood planks were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful as Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was a street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strikers and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were used in the past, the wooden planks were torn up.</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said that they saw them fighting on the street and had to be invoked by the police on a regular basis</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogierte it and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogions were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They were not talking about anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have been given the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were established at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown site of the community house</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogiation is always the last step that considers Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of house management will now have to remove rubbish mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police passed a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine, after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial custody.</seg>

<seg id="37">Having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they will navigate renters who do not stick to the rules of the house</seg>

<seg id="12">The Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.</seg>
<seg id="13">The spokesman said that the jet caused a little deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to the poor visibility of the area, but the air forces insisted that safety was at no time at risk.</seg>
<seg id="14">Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where there were also four people on the island of Madeira to death.</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately announced that it would promptly establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan function reported that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the Doping Controllers.</seg>

<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency, before the summer games in Brazil, exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia shall not vote for the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until 2021 the Sunday election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as so far it does not go: summer holidays, heat and land baldness - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "the locals, who are to be convinced by the campaign fighters, are on vacation." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">To do this, practical problems come: during the holidays helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count on voices in the end, only work hard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of coalitionist.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, you can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, spreading roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary wordy predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major demonstrations; Merkel's parliamentary election circuit is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's no shame for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual electoral campaigns on marketplaces and in front of malls with sunshades and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, cocaine thinks, only plays a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noticed that in the country you crumble the base that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU voter coke to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing:" "" "you have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the opinion polls, the Social Democrats last stood behind partners CDU (25) and only marginally before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD gained a clear victory of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the country's parliament." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the vacations and place their campaign largely on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "" "calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green election warriors go on search for local voters under the vacationers.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is reformed.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made it all rather jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite will also be praised by those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofandingen has been lifted and that the connection to Rottenburg is over again, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now sail from Odondingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were sometimes considerable complaints," "" "said the Deputy Head Office Manager Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachstitutes, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherfield had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping roads were seeking and rather familiar to their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchised.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because even the speed limits were not met, the congregation reinforced the measuring vehicle of Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were significant exceedences," "" "says King, who made himself informed on the spot himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the speed-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has gone further, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers coming from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales quarries allows anyone to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "", "i.e. for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "maximum slight drop" "", "but also admits that" "" "the search engine is missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most strongly depleted are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly krone, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "he is deciphering sales revenue to" "" "far more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "street renovation was" "" "thrown back for two years" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, answered with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all the complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regulars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot go down, it is also very nice elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="42">The fact that his family climate is coming back after the renovation works has no doubt about this.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customers for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before sharing the comment section, to slitte under the pseudonym Non-Allegatory Men's Middle-Ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the prevalence of vinyl records is not based on a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife-Nostalgie.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through hobbies - it has an emotional meaning: older plate buyers are more likely to retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and loosen wildly before I stay, hold my hands and say something better: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent vendors were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in direct proximity to various men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long for a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford as they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70ies that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably something too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my charge.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25 working with Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets to apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people usually got rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the plate revising of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar baffle sleeves, from objects that watch happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff member flickers from a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried as I flatten through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here recently and said:" I don't have record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead baffle so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-rich.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have record players."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who first come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "Fopp, dedicated almost all the way to the records, has a colourful audience when I go in." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesible and sexually-packed pop instead of experimental jazz moans from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but the mental trauma is hard to determine if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates to be sold.</seg>
<seg id="49">It looks more like a shopping window than a big shopping mall.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drifts away with a loving sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to muster the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid Cameras, before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley turntable.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that spends most of the luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they are ignored, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collector's female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning by strolling through the stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they steer clear of the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator that stands above the shoulders of unaware of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary stores in which individuals within the camp offer goods, from cigarettes to ergydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "" "" "humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais are "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas provide peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Great Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby came to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated at the deodoro stage in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji had a master class in handling, side quilting, back shifting, line running, and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - the fourth one on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji had struck a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a comfort for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan they lost each game to the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one thing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and left the attacks left off fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running in driving busses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 up when Osea Kolinisau raced in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A rival Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain from ManLeone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but Fiji just stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Amasa Veremalova went to the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-plumage and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak Tacclings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 while GB is still being taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova went through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favour of the South Sea Sulphians, whose fans sang, flags, and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GGB crammed crushing into the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scarce semi-finals from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown pushed the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emurinal gold than these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present when she moved to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who set such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, after all, their 39th uncanny deployment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no one more assistant than the trainer who didn't know 30 months ago if he would ever survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that was operable and they did that.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the correct term in such circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="10">The freshwater fitness association of the Veirsteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn, supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 locations and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants of the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WCC).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I'm really happy that we could finally achieve that after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said to the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, falle an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for the production of its own electricity.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous scheme is largely fixed.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "also in the reform of the emissions law, climate and employment targets are weighed," "" "explained IG Metall-boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation was further aggravated when the world's largest producer of products threw large steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers toss price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have accumulated.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp also wanted to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite increasing prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the requested quantity went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has risen by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output.</seg>

<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Magisterium studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "singing moves me - emotional and physical," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the" "" "Deutsche Seniorenliga." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir:" "" "to approach and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly ask their lungs will not be able to get out of the puff in everyday life too quickly.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors "Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers dethink of long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone are not just concentrating on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Hi, of course this post is genuinely nice and I have learned lot of things from it on the topic of blogging. thanks.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone comes from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one simply can join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people's choirs can also be found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who have no access to the internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="3">She suffered from wounds and had been treated in hospital, but I have already left this.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities, such as dumb.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hua Hin located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, where two bombs exploded on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosives were fired again, and another human being killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach of Patong which was popular during holidays.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded which killed a municipal clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flowery before the territory of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before reporters.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the attacks of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "in recent days, the authorities would have been receiving secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed of the exact time and places." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police told their officials all over the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but most of the time they do not judge tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani, and Songha as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and the population of the population, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, would benefit himself from having restored the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rippling revolt of Muslim rebels for years in the outermost south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nearly one year ago, 20 people were killed at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance by Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweighted swimmers from Ethiopia went so slowly that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special starting right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in sub-represented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most athletes are running in Ethiopia, Habte wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of sewage will amount to 2.10 euros for the sewage treatment plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44; for Zulte berg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (2,26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate measures for improvement are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a precipitous calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the household by the County Council Kulmbach, it was established that undercover for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulte berg will have to reach deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a new calculation of fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the grave fee increases with the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, wastewater output in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the recuperation period in all three plants, renovation and repair expenses have fallen in a considerable scope, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zulte berg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage in the sewage plant Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of after almost 20 years. the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility was installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "these extraordinary expenses came to bear the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that with the small waste of sewage in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were "smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of great entertainment costs in the wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to the opinion of stone houses, the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the sewage treatment association Friesenbachtal is not possible to expand these facilities because it concerns public deficits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" -effect criticized as an Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-inflamed, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All defects will come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past when they were blamed that the app would propagate Blackface promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and blown cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" "" "jaundice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if this repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and the indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company provided an apology: the filter was meant to be a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter reminded of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the Anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and bad."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-bearing, but that the yellow-face was pulled into the turning extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things will go unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorted ISIS intelligence information, rejects congressional committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel from the United States Central Command changed intelligence intelligence to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on the ground, an inquiry committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Armed Forces Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction with Central Command's secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically inspired by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government spikes under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, commentaries and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts," reported the report.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being admitted that analysts worried about manipulating reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom Reports are underway through the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the high-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff House of Representatives, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "preached the morality among analysts and" "" "gave excessively little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Ship and the democrats stated that they found no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts about a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress's investigations were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who had been taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the congress, while the inspectors of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations of last year have raised the question, however, that President Obama can rely on Central Command for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked at only a small occupying troops in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that, contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcom's condemnation, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for its excessively positive assessment of the military situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember having ever done.</seg>

<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Briton in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will converge on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer for the strong Dutchmen to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, the Americans triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey racket in hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely destroyed the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a reversal from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was going to play without a win in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the Trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympics are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and unavoidable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the Crossbow to a float to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to the chat of your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time with the Olympic Games and a flock of women with dimples, could certainly have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built up by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic gymnasts.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade there are sports, which are not generally accepted: aerial pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my particular favorite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so sparsely noticed that many who I had asked did not know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 an athlete, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on a trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it suits the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonerous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially combines it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "rebounder" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rising conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympics program, they are evaluated according to execution, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold continue to go faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, upwards and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the original wall, but also another high goal in the television transmission: that of the world or the Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I personally feel when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, moves up, then down, then effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolf in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will be held on Friday afternoon, in the streaming by 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13: 00 pm.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectivity of male athletes - as the male US-Turner proposed recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air to rinse, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police on shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The videos circulating about the protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to take a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Commission now demands a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the head of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is Nigeria's most populous country and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the country's opposition has been limited, whereas dissidents have been effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and don't have any other options except protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a professor in central ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years, can exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of taking turns under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they reside.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they gathered so much protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who come from Athopiens predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are in coordinating under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who account for around 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Minister of Ethiopia for seventeen years until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands protested against elections which, according to the statements of analysts, apparently had been plastered by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, like the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal disassembly of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, led by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights across the neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile country.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Donald Trump explains his claim to have ISIS established" "" "sarcasm" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification brought new questions to the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its fellow campaigners who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to declare statements he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made his way back to the allegation on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to point out that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism kicks off on Mr. Trump while trying to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling fractions.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later on, "Of course I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic borders in politics and then back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to hold his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump assumed an even more etching tone as his survey scores declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A recent poll by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great advantage in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he emphasises the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps's jokes have brought his loyal companion into the uncomfortable situation to face him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political commentaries" "" "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trump's testimony whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama is an almost unknown, small organization, he called them back-brokers, completely wrong, and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">The majority of the mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to expand by subjecting them to control the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of moving around on each of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on board the research ship Sanna, this shark was allowed to go back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie will only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Grönlandhai swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a rich 2.6km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle dominated by slowness seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case by a Grönlandhai who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerbare of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock explains this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland's sharks will become rock-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-arks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures of the six degrees centigrade, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them, when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make prey: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers, which torrent from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland haie, which caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens kernel of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already occurs before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons-seeking increased quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of 220 centimetres length of the third smallest animal, the core of the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their liner-core, which arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 cm for a 493 centimeter-long Grönlandhai, while the record shark with 502 centimetres might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only then get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold for sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-arks with the increase obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane emes live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland-whale, in its bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat from one gram of mouse is much greater than that of one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as soon as possible," "" "explains the Evolutionbiologist Scheuerbare." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">In contrast, a very large animal should invest its resources more into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were met together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage to all the registrants in two years, the ministerial circular St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Different pilgrimage targets have been tested and one finally decided for the Episcopal City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a particular pilgrimage goal was offered at the St. Petersburg Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims and shared the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster Our Lady stands and so the pilgrimage was started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The single day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts in the morning and evening.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis continued to sing along field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim's booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pastors of the local parish were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller arranged for a tasty and starving dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first we had to drop some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the poolside in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thanked.</seg>
<seg id="19">The minis of cooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train to Horb.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British Team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself to Eigen. the Jenny made the legend haughty when he stormed home to capture a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick once they took a modest sixth place at the London Championships in London in spite of the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom she stayed, when she saw potential in the Scotsman, which has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won an Olympic champion in the qualification laps, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which execution moved in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all skinners to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked out from his position as BBC expert and fell to Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they climbed to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and make a name for me.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the victory in 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, he admitted that after a weak start he dropped off on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a superb win this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">With so many world titles we got so bad that it was incredible to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it's in the realm of possibility that he won Hoys winning three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint he starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>

<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested with officials before the qualification yesterday when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong railway steering team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical director in April in the middle of sex and bulb allegations as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, who reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and last but not least because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium mould with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché episode of almost every birthday party of a child's programme (Seacremne brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris was forced to take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, surely a new era of the Kardashians began.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her beating the vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista, 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover stars is eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the journal will seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" celebrities "" "" models "" "" models, celebrities are "" "" on the cover "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true of Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistles of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the misfortune seems to pass at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhabitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could once have recorded erdsimilar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have pointed out beforehand that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still spun slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun shining 30 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow change of Venus is exposed to her daily side of the sun for almost two months," "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which looks like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is the average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide was left behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that as we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete range of rotational rates below the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster are rotating at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to the creation of planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Plejaden lies 445 light-years away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak-rotation rates, these mature stars meet large amounts of star winches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slow down pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the Plejaden Ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," says Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>

<seg id="2">Caught: due to a positive doping test, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio should not start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">An acquired athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping attacks have become known for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese swimmers in Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre-obstacle course in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically acclaimed athletes contests these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the courses of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report it should act in the forbidden substance around the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-specimen will have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov informed the athlete immediately with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide erect hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent poll of malware infection specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months became at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack using blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop. Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be repressed falls far higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching an appalling rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwareb's chief Marcin Kasmyzynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the MalwarePrograms were still designed to send commercials.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was alarming in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackjack.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stoppages.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies affected reported turnover losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of acts of illness.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Klectwski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up some kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to bargain in part and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Considering the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the job, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware in one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more likely, however, that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers only sell their malware in the form of a software building block to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware kits have been created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the delivery includes an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackjack then searches for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment will be made on an infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals instruct spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now well-known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies IT executives in the Malwarebyte survey focus on being able to repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assessment, the offenders are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwareb's chief Marcin Kasmyzynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators would also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerconference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blockaded heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the HR-V has only 1.60 m high, passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it doesn't work in any place.</seg>

<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI bushing are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But that is to change: the right-wing bidding is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic jams if they drive over the motorway at Zubringer (A 43).</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one is waking around forever; at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not long before the alarm bells no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as non-recovering.</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems manifest or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasized by Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you generally understand, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhaling and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the sleeping feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practical experience in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind these can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disturbance is an expression of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially for depression," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors necessitate each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two or three hours and possibly start to pondering about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look different: one is beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "there are hardly any occupational therapists in Germany," "" "emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the family doctor, he advises.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, civilians were arrested by two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several pocket and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30 o'clock civilian officials in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf once again recognized a gang that was known to policemen from past thefts.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had multiple delikes since the middle of July and were in a community, collaborative and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the Criminal Police Department 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thieves, who had been sent to Germany for the purpose of instituting criminal offences.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Rigaer Strasse in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">Walking along the road from east to west, one passes to playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "has sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin internal senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the premises on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, patrolling the police for three weeks with official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocking parts of the road and refrained visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the construction workers were renovating the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers moved under the chewing of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents go for walks with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, are generously annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the care of increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "it doesn't sound like a Kiez, who wanted to call for police protection against vandaliating leftists." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin internal senator and the police force between the house occupants and their neighbors, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house staffs and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former East German Democratic Republic, among them almost the entire Mainz street near the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainz Navy had been put in a veritable street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnets for tourists and electors from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them in quaked discs or newly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words" "" "left-wing violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: criminal offences, such as bodily injuries, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the criminal offenses are property damage, which tends to meet the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is important: the 94 people in the 94 are their neighbours, they are not sure.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rīga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from police, politics and media, which in July all were suddenly claiming the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: faceless newbuildings in former buildings that suppress the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually freehold flats, which are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so well-dressed," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you want to do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for drawn-out people who are angry about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who are moving should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the asylum seeker for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group Refugees, Administration, Authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying Wollmilchsau, who primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking but rather aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The search was carried out with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, giving a lifelong Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not its central area, meaning Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organising, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "new containers are soon left in the washing line" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves must bear the costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District council office to the municipality and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work so far, so it is dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community dwellings need to be replenished, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>

<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>

<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach may not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there is also problem cases," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people with whom nothing works." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine's customer says quite clearly," "" "what some naively name may be called." "" "a residual risk could and would not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also the subject of refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would completely invade them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "so chief and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the old people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
