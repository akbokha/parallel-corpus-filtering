Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement expansion and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s will to do the peace process .
by Barack Obama &apos;s deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly scored as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with reference to Israel &apos;s imminent election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girlfriend has been shot dead
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ pit@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled for 300 miles to the school premises , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency call at some point later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but potentially difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he was also a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would no guarantee for him an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found lam@@ bs later when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ elle Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb began in 2009 at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doc@@ torate in education in the spring .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through mutual friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time , he was the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ba@@ you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both appeared on a summer carnival three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse that worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had ended his guitar and harmon@@ ic play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in Native American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended about 900 people on Tuesday evening including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a commemor@@ ative cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch vi@@ gil , while the university ch@@ oral &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call called Pr@@ enti@@ ss while his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to employ fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it was planning to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . in the Christmas season of 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip the shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I have a simulated ste@@ aming and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really good for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ ably the biggest time travel movie ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be seen on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theaters in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the split UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
in a press conference on Wednesday , Ban said that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the US , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the crisis in Syria , Ban ordered the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they have demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national p@@ olls showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some start wondering seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ty &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them had only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like everyone Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tru@@ mp@@ s staying power and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey results suggest@@ ing that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Aff@@ ord@@ able values turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week confirmed that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tru@@ mp would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son brings about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Tru@@ mp ) .
next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see Tru@@ mp@@ s Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters think that Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first choice state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money hats , Republi@@ can voters hold Tru@@ mp for real .
if they are asked who will most likely win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week say four out of ten that Tru@@ mp was the best bet .
this is a change since the moment when four of the ten end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet , a large number of GO@@ P voters have seen Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ ap@@ ing majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support the Tru@@ mp say they have firmly entr@@ en@@ ched their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say change the mind .
46 per cent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
yet Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rapi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration of turning and fishing was in public discourse for 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , there will appear to be Donald Tru@@ mp .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new heights .
Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son now account for about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with a government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans at the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish upset . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ look@@ er way is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt .
in the street , a square meter of a that@@ ched roof will cost 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , one of the prices comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square metre prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros there - per square meter , well @-@ noted .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ time Tor@@ po@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern the dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won the Champions League performance in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8@@ 9th ) scor@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in Serie is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th hit in the Champions League for the Bavarian lead , Müller was rewarded with good help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass a shot of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm was promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 3@@ 88 fans - and the Munich kept his word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with gre@@ ek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran courage@@ ously , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often preceded by a game shift to the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first , as the Olympic champion , Ide@@ a Brown struck the Pole &apos;s head@@ ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then , by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ed with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set need@@ les .
at the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was leaving .
so for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ a via the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the kay@@ ak , initially sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after finishing the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the wounded Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of mostly ver@@ m@@ bled Bavarian fans apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich parti@@ sans .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
if you smoke , it damages not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study .
good news : in case of om@@ itting , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were exposed to the risk of losing their teeth ahead of time in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good oral health up to the old age .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists meet from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on remains from the late Anti@@ quity
for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , &quot; said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Monum@@ ents .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found a fifth .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to remnants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves has been discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman affected by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the station in S@@ cour@@ ty@@ ch Lin@@ den , the Federal Police asks the people to help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. the woman was coming from the railway station building at the end of the train station and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
due to the capture of the train , she has caused he@@ avi@@ est injuries to the German police .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by emergency cre@@ ws .
over the reason of the ni@@ ghtly railway crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the kill@@ ers .
the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or pedestri@@ ans from Lin@@ der@@ ner &apos;s railway , Ziegel@@ bä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .
information about the cause of the accident can be given at around the clock and provided free hot@@ line from the federal police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission proposes new justice in dispute over TTIP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to much more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner responsible for Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the US free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly fores@@ ee that the EU states and the USA will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the United States and from third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance planned .
it would allow it to appeal against prejudi@@ ces .
so far , the parties involved agreed with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens un@@ familiar to the old IS@@ DS system concerning fair@@ ness and justice , commented on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there may , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor state dispute settlement ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies pay compensation to tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act signed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission included key points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel developed in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the economy &apos;s law@@ suits by too many new rules .
in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us on the basis of different places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rit@@ us .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can drift into great opul@@ ent times at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a daring series : each of the 50 US states should be followed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , 2005 is a well @-@ known masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
borrowed from ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively on electronic auctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth recording studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ piece band .
in the dark @-@ star@@ red Hamburger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly ri@@ dden St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate basically throws away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself only to an en@@ core , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally feels like thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is anticipated with suspen@@ se in the prime minister &apos;s questions
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is expected to make his debut in the prime minister &apos;s questions and set himself up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre @-@ appointed questions just after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several ti@@ dal stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a speaker of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme ; he advised the Labour president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported it as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t argues that political differences are also pil@@ ing within Labour , &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour Chan@@ ges set aside to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Labour and R@@ ent Minister stated that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to lower the £ 26.@@ 000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory leader , over the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another political set , says he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head@@ gear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stri@@ pping with re@@ ins instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economy Minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad .
he also discussed the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &quot; theatre , often linked to the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the deal with the Prime Minister was seen as the chief bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require extensive reforms .

£ rise by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the Po@@ und climbed according to data that indicate a rise in the UK &apos;s wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and delivered assessments since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the Po@@ und climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer by Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ z@@ sch .
according to the encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - report growth .
shares of Glen@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his valuation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sold . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased 3.1 % after reporting a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are fewer extra jobs .

Pe@@ gi@@ da Pla@@ kat brings Lebanese to the pat@@ ron@@ age idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ ant Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a plac@@ ard at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ e@@ wer is spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ ar@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea was to have the Lebanese admitted to the patent office in Munich in the meantime .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
for this reason Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes it contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash launches sustainability @-@ campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA @-@ supermarkets bol@@ ster their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distributed samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners selling dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual investment strategy day .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ an &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s sales in the food and food business grow by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told at a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
met@@ a refused to publicly respond to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trading , which approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operative debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , wholes@@ al@@ ers rep@@ u@@ di@@ ate and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their shops by fast growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and up@@ loading programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit for the first time in four years in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick C@@ yr@@ gion and ear@@ ns praise as criticism of his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the not@@ orious confron@@ tations of C@@ yr@@ gion with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison having called out : &quot; wr@@ in@@ ka could have sm@@ ashed , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f ei@@ gled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am very rich about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a m@@ allet out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account at the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on competition and not all around the controversy , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I believe that Nick made a quick ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency situation and sm@@ ashed the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed on the fron@@ tier when hundreds of migrants were in a No Man &apos;s land , and Serbian officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people , who fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver over them , the immigrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would return , while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a controversial meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the cor@@ rupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would accept more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes in a swift action of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday brought authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most emerging economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into effect at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence , which the government had to build along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation resulting from the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesman Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press re@@ porters have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on a day @-@ to @-@ day basis .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ loading off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ er voters ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ ander generated some gains .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among the men has decreased considerably , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month , Clinton was S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want she is the candidate is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ ti@@ bility are also quoted .
since the vice president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors are asked for the prim@@ aries who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders will increase from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ fish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , Demo@@ cr@@ at voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries is unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results with some important features in the election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office are to be continued as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most demo@@ cra@@ cies of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinion .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have deterior@@ ated by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of her party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 % of the voting rights do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of the voting rights nationwide see Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp receive good management notes , however .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the failure rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre @-@ election election is 6 percentage points .

Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp across the country . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son increased from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes the Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker who has fallen at the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida Gover@@ nor of Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , is located at 6 % in the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tru@@ mp found some side screens for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp on Saturday , during a campaign presentation in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , for bathing lovers , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short treat at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
almost two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood interven@@ ed brut@@ ally during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police with .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack loaded with sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the Society began to hide and set the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gn@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been repeatedly added to mu@@ te force injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members need to be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of deportation and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood can re@@ vo@@ ke their belonging to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest raise comes , and the household will fall into w@@ ob@@ bling , returns for bonds will rise and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the time needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could , however , find that all the excitement was exagger@@ ated because of interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first rise in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high@@ s , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid of .
however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as seen in the market last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that asset yields may be amor@@ ti@@ zed for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going to happen after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis , which released Bob Dol@@ l , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks tends to occur later in the upgrading cycle and returns the return on investment .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent for the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is it different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants accepted the F@@ ed interest rate all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all elevation cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers were put in the shade very soon after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in equi@@ ties when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns appear to change the direction once the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the under@@ mining cycle , the endi@@ ves immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher earnings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st near Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that Jones considers that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve has increased , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has tigh@@ tened its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the larger part of their business operations in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firm of the Year for Trade@@ marks and Un@@ fair Competition Har@@ m@@ sen U@@ tes@@ cher Firm of the Year for M &amp; A No@@ er@@ r Firm of the Year for Media Rau@@ e
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher earnings , even if experts in different opinion know how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he argues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading parliamentary member and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , appear to be only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponents when it comes to live music and enligh@@ tenment .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argued Alan Dav@@ ey that harder work would be to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport in order to tre@@ ad the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated 22 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was produced as a judge - &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment was launched .
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the expenditure in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Mr Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index for the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for subsequent sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers hit their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the buried in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia bent down the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mosque .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building kr@@ an over@@ threw the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the bed@@ ders .
the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi King had imposed a san@@ ction on the Ben Laden construction company due to the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 dr@@ unk@@ ers who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central @-@ mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual p@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the state @-@ owned Saudi Press Agency stated that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the sick that crashed into a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ler , which is taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements on the breakdown of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ lied the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large @-@ scale mosque as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over major construction projects .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the cheap East European arti@@ sans is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has increased
this results in 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores targeting cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople .
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q outlets are closed nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
if you are skil@@ fully b@@ yp@@ assed with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you apparently belong to a minority these days .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ haus chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ ford shops that focus on professional tra@@ des@@ people and close their 60 outlets of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are affected by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households which do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our women account for 80 percent of the decisions on purchasing articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed exactly 50 per cent of the team with women , including its Executive Board and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and turnover after the group reduced the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob about in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob would have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosecutor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that in 2006 @-@ 2011 , the accused used mon@@ ies of the assets they could disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he estimates the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was eliminated by the President of the Sho@@ v@@ ist Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset was created to the association .
the sports function@@ aries would only have charged expenses and the sports club , for whom they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of their debts - the Passi@@ va em@@ bos@@ sed around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; at that time we were confronted with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ basket of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial department .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made .
in addition , in the case of financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expense reimbur@@ s@@ ements had been resolved retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore you have paid a part of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump sum and not detailed illustrations appeared , the former ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and pass@@ books managed the two def@@ endants in common , the second accused said .
why the payments have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not interest in detail for the financial institutions , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , as a result of an official investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were def@@ endants , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known according to the statement of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosecutor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , wanted to know judge and prosecutor .
on top of this , the first def@@ endant ple@@ aded that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ es and diets .
on diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article .
these were no longer stored after an audi@@ ting where everything was judged to be correct , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ endant .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , and he said in his statement from his hom@@ etown of Nations on the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard delivers another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been going on for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will disman@@ tle more jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the sub@@ missions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs are to be saved in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the 5@@ 5,000 jobs that have been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the stock exchange , He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares were 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , which has become a big corporation with printers , is currently split up : so the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts shall be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ appointing PC he@@ el , as well as a weaker customer demand for his services , followed the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus revenue declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a split and massive sub@@ missions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly lead to rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent expressed themselves appro@@ v@@ ingly .
the fact that other countries are flying air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
a cooperation with Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show

the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took refuge at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the scenes a police line had formed and a water ej@@ ector stood behind the police officers .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers began to use pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a bit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the area .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas shri@@ eks .
other refugees stuck together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the U.S. emergency tank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters found that a little more than half , the last week &apos;s view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate applied to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero sector and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , leading employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death thro@@ wer at the Delta State University left ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and said that he shot someone and killed someone .
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send police officers to his home .
he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but will probably be upset .
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally killed his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testified that they were married for about seven years , was described as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter that is 19 and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb have called relatives on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate degree from Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , such as his W@@ age on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought Leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor has also claimed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all of this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives will cost the Group &apos;s conversion to the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and upgraded the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to contribute to an earnings contribution of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no executive board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , Managing Director Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be in charge of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with its new job , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 staff was highly complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the Collec@@ tive Agreement with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the judicial strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forecast record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to come to sustainable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots the background is the austerity concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa has out@@ sour@@ ced Euro@@ wings to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defender to weeping and excluding him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has double bass and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a Red Card and the hanging of an electric meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an eleven meters and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
based on this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V
the UK distributor has an additional incentive for the European Championship in France to recover until the next June .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a collision with Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Mr Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron report@@ edly describes the plot of the book , res@@ umes a content release of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ itz @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this would not be susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron is in part read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ itz @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is admitted to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the act of the book . here , an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment is rav@@ aged by monetary gre@@ edy , trees @-@ prone , ten@@ acious natur@@ es , &quot; which speaks in the name of trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
b@@ ump@@ ing into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the Ka@@ der that England chose for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the Community Spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are based on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further races for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the UK @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss pra@@ ises his attitude , even if he did not deliver so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton was given the chance to play home and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales came in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up highly .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which made us very happy .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred races immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he was very impressed by me as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game to bring a wealth of experience , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights we can benefit from .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players don &apos;t determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could win allow@@ ances if the economy goes into a l@@ ull in 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ declared re @-@ negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ n and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they mostly do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it may not , if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance minister climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , looking forward to looking outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the over@@ done long expos@@ ing like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally plan un@@ helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain did not win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , however , as they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our admission 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they cannot remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990 &apos;s .
with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ caring villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ queu@@ ing foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought much about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of serving his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never for@@ given him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly outline on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and now .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the willing followers of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , do not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be compas@@ sion@@ ate towards his co @-@ workers without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Gary &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his co @-@ workers and dep@@ uties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no open card for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity regarding the EU membership - in line with her Benn@@ ite siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , to which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigarettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mary Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on demonstrating efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco remedies ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco management of P@@ he also took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e cigarettes as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative risks associated with tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking is the national health system two billion pounds per year .
by pointing out current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should abandon the East@@ Def@@ enders , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a hard @-@ cont@@ ested newspaper window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which are clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communication Committee during his investigation on BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to hold the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think of a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others don &apos;t do or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funding is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ Def@@ enders is another , admitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC to blame for reviews is &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments about the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ender .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal &quot; niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify $ 4 billion broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call on you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you think all of us think that you get a great value for £ 150 each year , but for people who have a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ chi@@ an mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educate , educate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and it was supposed to &quot; inform , educate and enter@@ tain &quot; to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown and enter alliances with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses are caused by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive method that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms generally do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ ves@@ icles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages compared to this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that fo@@ dder devices are not illegal in front of our front door . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , I was a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls is from easy nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell where you get , whether and where you have taken a sab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people .
people often turn into beverages @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and che@@ ek their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ culture @-@ culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead .
talking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering tasty home @-@ made treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you &apos;re a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead people to sleep when they knock .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal wis@@ ely as my room@@ mate who added to her milk a pur@@ ge to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who are sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbors , if they make up something , drum &amp; bass qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door and went to their three @-@ hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move to the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be ab@@ ys@@ mal embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take her to her , separate herself and then see her every day and maybe experience how she moves all together friends to her ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co@@ hab@@ itation is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ belly a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his not closed room , the boundary between an el@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good ste@@ alth is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water which will then put you in the freezer - but do not tar@@ nish your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner builds in the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need home space , but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are forced to enter the housing market .
entrepreneur Mark Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheap housing can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here to a great extent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you put people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers .
each apartment has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I made my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
Gre@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for this .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely is not right .
but don &apos;t you tough@@ en up the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built up luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees but also the self @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the poor servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and cheap building today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message telling us that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is failing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the attack goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the passing of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the telephone might switch to half way and this could lead to a termination of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a slogan against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup II pointed out before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before the race in Singapore on this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ time champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the previous 12 season races and is also attacking the flood light Grand Prix in the city &apos;s state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city @-@ state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate play@@ w@@ right and tennis player who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st Class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ berger is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ gur@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the Social Foundation moves it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , from now on , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of nursing and nursing homes .
for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant nursing service that often nur@@ ses are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many services of the insur@@ ances are not in@@ frequently used , because the complexity of the insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ín and the civil hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to do this , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can take advantage of additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the sen@@ iors &quot; centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis perfectly complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is syn@@ onymous with prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis described .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration ceremonies , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising programme . &quot;
this makes the Foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 years old
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died already on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus told on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the broadcast .
born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at the Friedrich Leh@@ mann University of Technology during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but he also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .

in the city of Bremen , the alleg@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are seeking the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23,@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afghan , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and struck him with his fist on his face .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ ckets , he first dropped off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and ran several times over there .
when one no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male .
the victim &apos;s face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim were beaten with the help of a stock@@ pile .
the injured had to be hosp@@ ital@@ ised for medical care .
until now there is only a vag@@ u@@ ely perpetr@@ ator description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second but@@ cher should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to acquire wheel breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs lord mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country , physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lacking luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field of field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen retired , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side with half a job for his successor in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened up the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the fields of field discovered Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing her medical training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to get into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the husband Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss coming soon .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
meanwhile they are still living in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed in several doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as an emergency doctor in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and engaged in voluntary work in the D@@ RK @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ es , want to settle down as a resident physician .
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the renovation , the spaces will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of 50@@ 000 Euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme of the county ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ aut mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ lows each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor found itself , it would have gone too .
anyone visiting Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultation hours , by the way , still looks at familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the fields of the field .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she feels a little sad@@ ness after the long time already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter site . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can also &quot; self @-@ evidently &quot; do so .
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia has been denied &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to move forward refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Internal Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as an outer border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants not to seal its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like the Croatian government , the first refugees in the night hours on Tuesday tried to drop by in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly hit police vehicles with new refugees ever since in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days his country will be counting 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be diver@@ ting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id had arrived in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia the whole night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could now actually come to a slightly further west @-@ west route to the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the Balkans Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not disclose details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities of border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report to the country since then , as far as the standard of border controls affects .
on the Serbian side , there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down on Wedn@@ es@@ days at a local show in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise immigrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps to the refugees , on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region .
Bör@@ sen @-@ h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having provided insight into still un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ing- and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der stores should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 more accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim for 20 years
there is a lot of activity around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .

you control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ alon at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep the railways .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce , with this action , drew attention to its 20th anniversary and was confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by just as much for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously grab the chal@@ k and take the sentence &quot; my life affir@@ med , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ al Association of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why this public action is good for the 20 year old .
the fact that not everyone wanted to communicate openly on the boards was understandable , but finally it was a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer &apos;s experience , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said a gain of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ends , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view is despite the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els which will be raised from November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online retail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex was earning $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion for analysts .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ sts , which resulted in sales in its unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
net sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the gro@@ cer for the first time in almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States threatening above them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story session hall .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all the other things .
the Central Bank has a two@@ fold order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices remain stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ riv@@ alled third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it is announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close @-@ to @-@ zero interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it is growing solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets would be anxious to strengthen the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed Represent@@ atives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which will ins@@ ure itself to the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists recently interviewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate increase this week .
financial markets , however , expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would cancel the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rate raise would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
one month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average dropped by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cur@@ b global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , but the Dow is now almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influences complex calculation when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US National Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be taken into account in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere suggestion of the former Gover@@ nor , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net , Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , de@@ votes himself to raise interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives did reverse these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s compo@@ unding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest turbul@@ ence is not coming close to this level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she &apos;s afraid of a raise of interest because the markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should hurry ahead .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the c@@ asses and has different take @-@ on options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more .
the meat counter is extensive , just like the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ e@@ ze the fish and even fry on request for you .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a whole series of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , it is quite different from teaching than at a proper school .
Rio Grande &apos;s Brazilian Pedi@@ atric Society promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS seeks to explain women in a sho@@ cking manner how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does so with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck to breasts which are painted with portra@@ y@@ als of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , giving babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation to mothers .
a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects pregnant women and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried has approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ anticipated gymn@@ as@@ tics construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent Municipal Council , the processed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , among other things , the committee had decided on an application for a structural &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ centered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of planning , the planned use of the roof area for solar systems is : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Joseph St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof ti@@ lt required for energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the planning plan for the roof ti@@ lt allows no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council usually proceeds more restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ alisation orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the case of gymn@@ as@@ tics , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ as@@ tics center at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots promotion .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the State Council .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the farther @-@ existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the resignation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play with the question of who was willing to take over the lead from October 1st and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer will work with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree on both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , if the current renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also the chairman of the supervisory board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a day @-@ to @-@ day psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer via the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who was welcomed by the employees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a suspect , a twenty @-@ year @-@ old , too , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was indeed admitted and the investig@@ ators led to the site of the cor@@ pse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the ceremony indicated that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the detention hop@@ per on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to death .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable lead .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution events on the German home market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is already over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid apartments .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; Social housing construction . &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ term accommodation .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has a budget deficit in front of itself , which becomes bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently approximately 77@@ ,000 units have been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in non @-@ penet@@ rated WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the loud noise on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggests a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
thus the tax on Gr@@ under@@ value tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed housing will be suspended for a limited amount of time .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the alliance .
the support programme for Kf@@ W refugee shel@@ ters is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have already been launched on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no more passage to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit across Slovenia north@@ wards without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous however .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the expul@@ sion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically eliminate proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border to the EU neighbouring country .
most of them were media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
just before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws define the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threatened arrest sentences of up to five years and the expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established at the border , of which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children as well as two elderly people were among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
practically , however , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they picked up the tr@@ ash which tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the last weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself at the end of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria gains only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1,@@ 400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we were occupied after the bridge festival on Sunday with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing with travel dec@@ ors at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
on Sunday , however , because of the stream of refugees , Germany had suddenly stopped railway traffic with Austria , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
first of all , we first looked for the unexpected guests , with a snack and a drink .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not afford to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers on Sunday evening switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u , after the short notice that railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still to try the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before , a two @-@ brid@@ ging run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially opened the attitude of the Hungarian government to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ lop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blessed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing migration flows and the approaching winter , in which we establish decent conditions for those seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try districts
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all his hands with the burden of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recording centre has already got a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad anticip@@ ates a demand of 8@@ 5,000 items per year .
in order to meet the number , there will still be 35@@ ,000 available accommodation in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these would have assured him of creating quarters for the refugees arriving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday Con@@ rad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that the employers must observe a certain amount of towel holders or the size of their duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Interior Ministry he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad justi@@ fies his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom you don &apos;t say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cost the republic any cost as they explained .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own quest for accommodation has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says that this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers can be accommodated at the moment without these measures .
however , for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , additional sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism exercises the head of the city on the division of refugees inside the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ des further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special moves with refugees to Germany .
however , those seeking refuge would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T has moved in . the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ based companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later acquiring them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin inaugurated second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ Hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
Jutta Br@@ ing wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
it has been re@@ mod@@ elled several weeks earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking about whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the ven@@ eer producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten Br@@ ing from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tran@@ ce , also the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag is inv@@ ali@@ dating every outfit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called sen@@ ders .
some of them also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself xen@@ opho@@ bic , analy@@ sing journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fres@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 @-@ resident @-@ village are related to it over -@@ ty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ stadt has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , among which also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts as well as Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the real estate company foundations were first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their home in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp was the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the desc@@ endant .
it had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the United States and required the construction of a border wall to deter il@@ lic@@ it immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Polish , it &apos;s not so like@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather distant to the Americans , &quot; he is always so crum@@ bling . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like some K@@ all@@ stadt , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els film , for which Tru@@ mp was interviewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 theatrical war@@ ders , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for the award of the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to assume the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in today &apos;s valu@@ ations .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise reached 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today , Today , Today , the figure reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ ech@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decided to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could perform a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators , beating the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening , two from The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos; Ke@@ efe yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 viewers and in the second half hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars a minute that failed to over@@ run Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show .

the last three agree : b@@ achel@@ or Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly appear who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , where Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was covered with the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally added an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have shown themselves in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could get their answers to the game per@@ ver@@ ting who won the b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s heart .
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and I noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week was clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this was obviously not just a game - I &apos;m un@@ condition@@ ally hired on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne to the ban@@ ker for the rest of the game when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a reinforced Hay@@ ne publicly during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ ts@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his caught catch and take care of the next game .

it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass reached a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free elec@@ tors demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Autumn show in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert von Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there weren &apos;t enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said A@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get publicity in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Free V@@ oters takes place until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as did during the Yugosla@@ vian wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why he also called for more staff for administrative courts in charge of administrative courts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es off , others are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more action @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in the city of the big wall should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a long @-@ standing burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ minister@@ Chancellor Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Inter@@ mediate plus &quot; at 47 high schools in which an extension of the secondary school of three to four years is tested - as a result , it will take nine years to finish the school .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools that want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .

solid profits also booked the commercial venues in London and Paris .
in the United States , the Dow Jones Index recently noted around 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to appear on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures trading . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep marks on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing € 30 billion in provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the U.S. startup magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took effect from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors still paid too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investment in promising Waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were dropped again than in the same period of the previous year , as the AC@@ EA trade association announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent or 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after police shot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district Rup@@ an expan@@ se , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , comm@@ anding district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside of a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ hak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known by which they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last one in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the law@@ makers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the site at Em@@ den youth centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete proposals yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den city wants to market an approximately 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. plot in direct proximity to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is said on the part of the city .
what investor is coming into question is not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no treaties have been signed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the plot that is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner Great Street , already a few months ago , and the building that is located on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure flight
for months , the doors closed behind closed doors , dim@@ ples , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea close to Em@@ den are located on the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council Urban Development Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on to the offensive from System Bau @-@ Management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all ru@@ mo@@ urs now .
some ten to twelve million euros have been deb@@ ated in the discussion for months .
hef@@ ty reactions among owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like some other project critics , that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come to ensure that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to disclosure of the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / was doubled to 11 million dollars .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data needs a long time to show , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , are comparing two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach cre@@ aking - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes @-@ disease was totally and partially healed at 28 % .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c reflecting blood glucose levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , leading investig@@ ators Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also posted average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rop@@ lasty Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.7 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.@@ 1 % ) and showed a complete over@@ ride of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to the survival of surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , adding that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 , and emphasized that the US violent reaction dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
poison control centers in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow hard alcohol dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , which report poison control centres , climbed from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in the social media .
YouTube videos show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few spra@@ yers can cause alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in small children .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky lying around , but people make this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when kids come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes from after straw@@ berry fra@@ grant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ acked her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing down dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the sh@@ en@@ ched plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ ps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures against the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are ru@@ mo@@ urs about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was dismissed by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontaneously . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers center player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak of the Old Course .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ estate @-@ games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that he has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen followed , which now stands at the top of the table with a five @-@ point lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ahead that he pointed out that he made some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about the signing of new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stur@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires in the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty ank@@ le for two years and has not abol@@ ished the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts suspended for N@@ eil@@ sons comments due to N@@ eil@@ sons comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was removed later - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and persi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power to comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ co@@ ag@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex @-@ heart@@ ts Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s safe to say that I will not return to Ty@@ te@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but stands for the decline in the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his crew from Aber@@ deen has to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton accoun@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory , giving them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or games that won &apos;t win games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bo@@ thered the process

why I Will Be Wit@@ ness of an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ ar lot@@ tery is held to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pencil to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of the deed .
but I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to die a man die unnecessary death .
man after wet police pursu@@ its persu@@ aded to come out of the scanning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman stayed dry when he talked to the man of the scanning river .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called to a conci@@ li@@ atory incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tactic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the tren@@ ch to escape from alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t swa@@ ying test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like over@@ hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I &apos;m doing with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy told rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard S@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behavior and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it .
but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on her and urge her to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the Sunday treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which was against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was what it was like .
but it had it on the race day as well .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting back
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called criticism of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ straße &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed remark on the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s tac@@ kling and said that they were only focused on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team were confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s always up to me - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about rest@@ au@@ ration when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock to him .
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrilling soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm Against R@@ oo@@ sters had a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team was free at this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night at the semi @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
beer with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long penalty due to his attempt to get to the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ threatening punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that could have been in the café for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he announced on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police of his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations , it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he gives up his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tear@@ ing apart
during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in the direction of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left in the last minute , as the police told me .
the accident @-@ causing driver &apos;s cab is completely dis@@ assembled .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 am .
the result was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used telephone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping bird .
she saw it through , found the confusing news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web research , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he then preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosecutor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search was carried out by him , but said that it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have taken in@@ decent pictures of children on the 14th of June last year , and did not appear before the Court on 24 March this year .
defense lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g would not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted security deposit in this case but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment day .
slu@@ user switches to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are being taken up from the large @-@ scale control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokesman of the Federal Police said .
more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn areas along the river river Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and du@@ st@@ eries on the German side .
there they are received from the Federal Police Department and forwarded to the Regi@@ stration Office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich central station , according to the German Federal Police Offic@@ ers , significantly more refugees came in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 700 people were in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : runner of tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the southwest expected &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm fires in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , divided by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years , the motor@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the International Motor Show .
in 2015 , there is above all a movement for the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were attributable to this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 - 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new top @-@ class cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at the deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is also not supposed to be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim . Opel is launching an entry underneath the biggest competitor Volkswagen Golf , which will start at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be driving alongside the Astra at the IAA to new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the show in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is to be seen at the International Motor Show .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ bes@@ ers laid hands on the front part : here the radi@@ ator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated in Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI have been added to the compact class at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel judicial system , which had been housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners basically claim financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were confined within a few days into the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
this was a successful former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with a floor area of about five square meters between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
after that the man , according to his lawyer , was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant was failed because of the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin .
however , the judges lifted the verdict of the Berlin Court of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
you see man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court decision now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons from the question@@ able period only a few days of arrest warrant were decisive for compensation , there was a compensation claim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the level of the damage compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multi @-@ assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ discrimin@@ ate housing in a parallel accident in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged from 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to head@@ lines because of lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ siv@@ ity rises , even to massac@@ res it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Department of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of junior staff , 19 are to drop off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the report by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to the report by Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) showed determination in the face of the un@@ common challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) are used annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units drop out of the lease agreement , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments every year would have to arise and therefore the Federal Government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
however , refugees in Germany are not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial that they find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the Danish government , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Resi@@ denz@@ pflicht , the asylum seekers are limited to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the point of view prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of knowledge of German is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
until now , there is no sufficient range of general and occupational language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the building of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the King &apos;s Way to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for parents to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in Berlin &apos;s Senate administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators increased strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal state denied asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to so far was Berlin , Interior Senator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student @-@ willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a given cre@@ mation or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er law more when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the latter do not get a banner , since they do not fall under the circle of the people entitled to the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this gap will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches law to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam need to agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also includes the willingness to face religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately got their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole society much more now than today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a General Equality Act for a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed where the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
the same chances for all : what migrant organisations and stakeholders of non @-@ white German require for a long time and why international treaties such as anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit themselves must become a reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medi@@ cally sufficient medical care to the previously expected refugees , writes the Minister of Health , Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all newcom@@ ers to negotiate health cards immediately .
services rendered could later be invo@@ iced with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able that so many people are vent@@ uring off with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum application law provides .
otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barrier .
previously , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more informed of their disease than other patients .
translation costs have to be taken over not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices .
however , many refugees would also have been helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee women there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially other diseases German doctors are coming from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ est@@ ation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and concerning the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualification and possibly pass tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the German psycho@@ therapy chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and lack of concentration , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , &quot; Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the welfare offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract every age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the circus performer invites you to dream in the arena on a brick .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ er and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for lovers lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphasized the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with a world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the circus program impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to easily absorb the Cuban duo .
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst looks also fascinating with flair and dex@@ ter@@ ity .

no problem for He Yu@@ an .
fascin@@ ate and sc@@ are at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve countries offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s not good for our animals , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel good , it does not want to go into the arena .
the highest bid , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jump@@ suit , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people are watching , we always do our best and are with their whole heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst loads from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. to his performances .
on Sunday the programme starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with bu@@ hr@@ ing .
last month , they had put on him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for the politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will split up in two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts result in a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who will forward the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and diversified portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions to companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical equipment and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and as long as his rehabilitation went according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain in the next summer .
the big dis@@ grace on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back in the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not traveled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and to allow players who need to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal &apos;s favor@@ ites are to advance through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , whereas the Rich@@ ter@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 was measured .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and is driven by the far @-@ reaching hope to lead the club to its first European victory with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in Arsenal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Party : the Com@@ edy Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death among males aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to question the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms discovered that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship .
in the age of social media communication , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominant .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy luck .
the beauty at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football matches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men can relate to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a colleague of telephone counsel@@ ing told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my inter@@ rog@@ ation role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ r@@ ity with the back @-@ designed cou@@ l@@ isse to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k with .
or even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know the difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent on comedy Central from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fes@@ tivities
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to disman@@ tle Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ guy Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the review and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince parking stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ set at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the final three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a clas@@ ses@@ ho@@ und from Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became involved in the game against his home town team and against the club , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems and to look back relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team in one of three changes that last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing of the wing was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and nicely into the long corner of the network .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field lined up a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps pins in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some fla@@ ws and bad connections , last but not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in no less than five experiments alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c whom Di Maria turned into a shooting net , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had refresh@@ ed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi identified a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not sufficient . &quot;
a hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played at that time for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four champion Champions League Champion , two time Club World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to Qatar for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already in Barcelona before the European Championships in 2008 .
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça signed a tribute to Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t switch that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns playing season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end he celebrated the King &apos;s victory .
Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety of films
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted when it emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protag@@ onist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian strengthened .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white stallion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dear White People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded in front of dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain her variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured covers .
in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated recordings of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
album Sti@@ ll matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ vers who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports climbing and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athlete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of its obstacle course .
during the seasonal finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , managed to finish in the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time , with which he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the quick@@ est person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it gets the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he has won any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so lucky to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a second season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the tw@@ ins wasted a chance to climb in one half of Houston knots for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp across a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories are fun , no matter what it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit was three times in the first two inside , then once in sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go to the game completely .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit song by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run away from the Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen right @-@ handed .
Gib@@ son Dun@@ n &amp; Cr@@ ut@@ cher Firm of the Year for Corporate G@@ lade Michel Wirt@@ z Firm of the Year for Dispute Resolution
it was the 27th consecutive year in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe defeated a double play
after Detroit , at the end of the ninth inning , added an insurance @-@ run , the wall abol@@ ished a R@@ BI double against the cil@@ ess of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , in the case of three pit@@ ches , the right @-@ handed people stab@@ bed S@@ ano for his fifth saf@@ ari .
at the start of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited from an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game by the vulner@@ ability list after having missed more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first place , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman , Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit him very well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning , before it was replaced by the Reli@@ ever Legal @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throw @-@ school .
he was examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder distortion , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to fight the wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing in the right hip joint since 20 August .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who are most excited are to be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden nar@@ rows on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital were prepared for this case over the last few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily .
they should then be further distributed to other municipalities .
in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government presi@@ dency of the government responsible for the first shot .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Germany &apos;s military action in Syria is an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking of military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way of looking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , we were glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controls at the southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Federal Minister for the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary again .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could pick up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
they did not call them concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee campaign in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view has been dealt with strongly in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 km border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be sealed with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from cre@@ denti@@ als to Romania , said Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .

under the polar star of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean flo@@ ats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moon is therefore te@@ et@@ ering on its orbit around the ring she@@ eting .
this motion is only small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice ceiling of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ itting the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing several weeks in Munich in 1860
the 1860 Group had to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Val@@ det R@@ ama for a month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation led to an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association with .
R@@ ama had been compla@@ ining about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s lions the diagnosis &quot; presumably means four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sporting director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a club @-@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kro@@ ate currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to demonstrate his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is to enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured his head in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
however , contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when purchasing Man@@ gos , they should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly sm@@ elled .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some blood salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ice and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS once again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already begun recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .

last year U@@ PS boo@@ sted its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have taken precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business .

first blow @-@ up , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night falls in the valleys of the top of the hair dryer through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and night to th@@ urs@@ day , the F@@ öhn wind blows through the floo@@ d@@ valleys .
after gro@@ aning on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the top of the Alps , the night falls on Wednesday of the fo@@ eh@@ n through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the valleys with gu@@ sts of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while the dryer for summer temperatures ranges from 23 to 27 degrees Celsius in the north on Wednesday , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the top of the Alps .
here rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , with some 100 litres of rain per square meter , it is expected that large rainf@@ all has already occurred in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn blows out the air , in the row a cold front with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east through Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind re@@ fres@@ hes up to stor@@ my temperatures and temperatures are dropping dramatically .
the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with temperatures of up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther pla@@ za
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther pla@@ za in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , he is now honored as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a welcome sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
Luther , with his theses , had initiated the split in the Western Church with his theses .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one ( gil@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs articul@@ ated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective topics , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and translated it into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his own personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old thus allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lady of the Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the education was done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on it so that I may also be able to bear the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is pushed out there .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to fully gr@@ asp@@ ing the Bible , but also selecting the most important , even mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; it &apos;s about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther Verlag is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans are made , place found , company commissioned , earth hill model@@ ed for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ink@@ ness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want the train . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill scre@@ wed up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permit will take place in October , the first community therapist , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck , could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works on the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga has a clear sign at the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must interest each and every one of us to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Frau Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must put politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; declared Ren@@ aus@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry on the stamp &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor@@ ing logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama captiv@@ ates everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale to qualify for the European Championships in Hungary on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent will be lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
in this and the next year , the association is offering 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the German federal government ( DF@@ B ) and the German federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye on accident
the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye in several reports by a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel vs. Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach is open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his family eleven at the R@@ eus location .
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the root but@@ cher Roman br@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ player R@@ eus , that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , sees Mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl as understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s cars : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
according to the government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the IAA of a &quot; new Mobility Age . &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , which also come together with industry representatives at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stressed among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy change@@ over to digital radio .
a test track at the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not impose additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h is raised .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more a passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways up to 2020 is technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving cars on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the issue of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , on behalf of the investig@@ ational organization Dec@@ ra , results in only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey conducted by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title fight between 25 September and 4 October , Düsseldorf wants to beat only in singles .
the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; that &apos;s a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys got to know it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to come back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ als in Ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the World R@@ ings Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on 18 September , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounds a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Die@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which a lot of effort was carried out : to synchron@@ ize the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated .
according to the Senator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , M@@ acher had made 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion @-@ attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course I bought them .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery industries in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers , which they proc@@ eeded to use for example , for blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer true today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en division .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en tip , fashion played a bigger role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vintage fashion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which leans against past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already consist of half of all orders .
gran@@ aries P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
our products barely reach our customers in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are distributed almost exclusively by chains .
exports are also weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date in Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger branch of the West Saxon university Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think of everything economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter rev@@ ital@@ ised the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sticks small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with a traditional P@@ lau@@ en tip before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en Peak - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to commemor@@ ate them .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en tip .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney still has a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the Great Depression of England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already determined : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to make the economy more broad@@ ly open to the world
the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state operations ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it provides the market with a larger role in the allocation of resources , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to advocate professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part as announced in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers to expect a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , which has a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of mis@@ guided industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of Food@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limits of the nerve toxic for large fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks and s@@ word@@ fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already heavily loaded with mercury so that around 50 per cent of catches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid border values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram in other fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are usually so low charged that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small quantities can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its website with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury leads primarily through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations em@@ it more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount they em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU @-@ warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
