the same procedure applies if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall be entered into force , i ) for non @-@ core weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and to become members of the association , in force , i ) when the relevant State of the Organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
( II ) if the Association of the Organization notes that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this State for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the parties to change the Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , Community and States .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement signi@@ fies the Convention and Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this section of the Convention shall be to determine the procedures to be applied in the execution of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction with the risk of early detection .
for the sub@@ missions of the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the amount of material that is not proven for a given period is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their inspections , the organisation under Article 3 makes full use of the community backup system .
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , see how they are specified in the supplementary agreements more closely and function@@ ally :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock or stock quantities ;
B ) assessing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ;
( e ) Proced@@ ure for evaluating the accumulation of non @-@ measured volumes and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that identifies the core material inventory and changes of this stock for each material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) Ur@@ an ( or th@@ orium containing material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet been reached , is introduced into the States , so the community of organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
( C ) nuclear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not authorised , the Community is not able or desired from residues , so consult the organization and the community to each other on the use of appropriate security measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realise that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization dispos@@ es of core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to the agreement , from these safegu@@ ards , provided the entire nuclear material quantity freed due to this article in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
( III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material together with core material , which is subjected to , processed or stored for the securing measures under the present Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ application of the securing measures are taken on that material .
the Community meets with the Organization supplementary agreements which are necessary in the scope which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention , in particular determine how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered in agreement between the organization and the community without modification of the Convention .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summar@@ ised inventory of the core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and carries on this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
in weighing downstream GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resources problems .
C ) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to the entry into force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this Agreement and the Central B@@ anks to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization uses a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; Man@@ age &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest promis@@ sory notes of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the State at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another point agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may make payments to the above dates if desired .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes roughly proportional draw on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan terms without remuneration ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ paid development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and administered by the ordinary means of organization , whereby the destination of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be taken into account .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of subordin@@ ate means by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which is approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore re@@ payable in 50 years each in ten free years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this clo@@ cks must be paid directly to the organization that keeps it .
each transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is indicated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country , or for goods or services manufactured or produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which the administrator at the time of the loan granted , may be recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments from special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full awar@@ ding of all transaction loans , the administrator has informed the EEC on the approval of the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of paying the special transaction loan , the administrator instructed the EEC on a quar@@ terly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the E@@ WG as soon as possible after the organization closes the financial year of the organization with a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this account closure .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and billing accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are made from account recei@@ pts to financial obligations , the amounts paid to the account and the payments received from the account , and the payments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account of time lead to an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transaction companies and all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organisation agree not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the Parties shall be charged with immediate effect .
if the total capital sum of all special transactions recorded by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the Parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper authorization of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month that follows the day of receipt of the mentioned No@@ tification at the Organization .
this agreement is written in two papers in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally authentic .

with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland is involved with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Tre@@ aties on Human Resources . &quot;
in view of J@@ ET &apos;s participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is at the time of entry into force of the present agreement to the Joint Enterprise J@@ ET , whose constitution is accepted .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is responsible for ensuring that Switzerland can contract any contract with its aim in the framework of the present agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs , which are commissioned with the execution of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 , paragraph 1 of the present agreement , are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement includes in particular the setting up of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and thus to direct the best possible results achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and the cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , is taking this task with regard to all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns its T * activity in the interests of both contracting parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss program as well as to the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement .
according to their Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program , whenever the responsible Swiss authorities seek for this .
the Advisory Group , which the VG research proposals would submit regarding the fact that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .

in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff names in the case of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears to include an article 12 up to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s consent to the previous one .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present writing with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm your government &apos;s agreement with the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks in credi@@ tor countries , if the banks make an appropriate application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some terms are mentioned below , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as with its event@@ ual extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts were not made before the exp@@ iry of a month following the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the dra@@ fts would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would take into consideration the bank &apos;s funds , presumably three or six months .
the terms would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds on the market , the rate of interest in the application could achieve a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when the banks submit an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you send me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to give you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in DER belief that stronger international cooperation should be carried out in such a way that greater liber@@ alisation , stability and expansion of international trade with meat and living animals is contributed ;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be tested on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively of the volume of the blood cell floo@@ ding in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set out for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time Standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the title indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the uni@@ denti@@ fied re@@ agent in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them again to a volume of 1 ml , so the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B will contain according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of similar tit@@ ling of the International Standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form , according to the label , is only one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the veri@@ fi@@ ability tests ; it is appro@@ ve by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 b.@@ H. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ oric tur@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents ) supplied with dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to develop the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood @-@ group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nit@@ rate per ml of flu@@ idi@@ zed or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in a fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination , which are determined for the international exchange , should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come into being through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents spent are to be kept from the laboratory until a certain probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and preservation of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective share .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each box contains a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the container , include the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention to this Protocol .

in addition , it is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood @-@ group serum or a corresponding comparison to ti@@ tr@@ ate against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case amount to less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ Y or A@@ o ) group .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % floo@@ ds of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination needs to occur within the double time that is necessary if the same attempts are performed with the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

if an anti @-@ A + an anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5 to 10 % floo@@ ding of A@@ x ( A@@ Y or A@@ o ) blood cells , then ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two species that are distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olog@@ ous blood cells is achieved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ completely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved with certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef bum@@ in or with the help of other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ ination to object carriers also include hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are lifted up in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells , which do not contain an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 compared to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , the serum is supposed to react with blood cells containing the Do @-@ an@@ tigen .
anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of slides in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more people , which are immun@@ ised by the Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen .
this Ser@@ a is therefore only specific for the C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9 % sal@@ ine solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ti@@ ter of the anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ ope blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 against C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form Anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer .
if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ ination period in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than with the ant@@ ei@@ c antibodies .
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances in group A .
anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of the blood groups A and AB including the sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ eal no human red blood cells , which contain no A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B .
