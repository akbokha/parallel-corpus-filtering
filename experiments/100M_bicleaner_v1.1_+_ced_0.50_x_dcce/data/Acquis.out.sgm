<seg id="645">A) In carrying out securing measures in accordance with this Convention, technological development is fully taken into account in the area of security measures, and all efforts are made to ensure optimum cost effectiveness and the use of the principles of effective hedging of the flow of nuclear material, which is subject to security measures, by using instruments and other technical procedures at certain strategic points, as far as current or future technology is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="646">B) In order to guarantee optimum cost effectiveness, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial fingernation as a means of determining the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the review process on the phases of the fuel cycle that could be produced by the production, processing, use and storage of core material, which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices, and the possible limitation of the verification procedures for other core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) To effectively carry out the securing measures in accordance with this Convention, the association of the Organisation in accordance with this Convention shall be given information on core material, which is subject to the safety measures, and on the characteristics of the equipment necessary for carrying out the securing measures in relation to this material of Belang.</seg>

<seg id="696">The aim of the safety measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the branching of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence from such a junction with the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">For the submissions of the target specified in Article 28, the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the amount of material that is not proven for a given period is listed under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified Megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their inspections, the organisation under Article 3 makes full use of the community backup system.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of their securing measures, the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and, as far as necessary, see how they are specified in the supplementary agreements more closely and functionally:</seg>

<seg id="710">B) Uran (or thorium containing material, which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c) has not yet been reached, is introduced into the States, so the community of organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided that it is not introduced for specific non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">(C) nuclear material, which is suitable for fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle, it is subject to the safety measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The hedging measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not authorised, the Community is not able or desired from residues, so consult the organization and the community to each other on the use of appropriate security measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The hedging measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community realise that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>

<seg id="725">The Community meets with the Organization supplementary agreements which are necessary in the scope which is necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the organization according to the Convention, in particular determine how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or altered in agreement between the organization and the community without modification of the Convention.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention. the organisation, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within ninety days after the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organisation provides a summarised inventory of the core material in the states, regardless of its origin, and carries on this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>

<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest promissory notes of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the State at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the outlet of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon;</seg>

<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes roughly proportional draw on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special transaction loan and compensate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">To the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan terms without remuneration; and</seg>

<seg id="752">Capital repayments from special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a Member State shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full awarding of all transaction loans, the administrator has informed the EEC on the approval of the directors in preparation and on the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of paying the special transaction loan, the administrator instructed the EEC on a quarterly basis on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EWG as soon as possible after the organization closes the financial year of the organization with a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external auditor of the organization for this account closure.</seg>
