this document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which discusses how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please refer to the package ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) .
B. Sever@@ al thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a psych@@ ic condition in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of anor@@ ex@@ ic high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time , which are just as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted to A@@ bili@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between nerve cells among each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole beha@@ ves like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and Dop@@ amine , but in a lower degree than neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters in order to activate recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased tur@@ mo@@ il over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il , compared with the placebo ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patient was examined by means of a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ e .
in both studies with the injection solution patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ am@@ idal disturbances ( un@@ controlled swal@@ lowing ) , vom@@ iting , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes continued to weigh on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the issue of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and related their man@@ ic episodes to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavi@@ ours belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ul@@ atory and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arise during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients with A@@ bili@@ fy treated patients signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be de@@ posed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events involving A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , an ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reduc@@ ers .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zers can result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ aboli@@ sm .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ ers should be made .
after removing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be raised to the dosage height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ mb@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yst ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned about using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - A controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ac@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients treated with O@@ lan@@ t therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients suffering from semi @-@ surgery treatment .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium therapy .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy have been reported to include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma cell connection .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1 receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
actual values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of return was observed for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ t controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a efficacy in week 3 compared to placebo , which was comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operated i@@ dol in week 12 .
also in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ zation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , nor did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia do not show gender @-@ dependent effects .
a specific study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indications of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ el cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ se carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al rin@@ ds in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 @-@ 3 times the medium Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16 to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human bile no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical peak dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ t controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical peak dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of A@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended to circum@@ vent adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with A@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different from schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ul@@ atory and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia arise during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ entary was greater compared to that after every dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly applied and at the same time lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , an ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reduc@@ ers should be made .
after removing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , A@@ bili@@ fy dosage should be raised to the dosage height before beginning of the accompanying therapy .

the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium therapy .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy have been reported to include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of A@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ raine reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe A@@ gi@@ ti@@ tis , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % .
actual values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including the P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Depres@@ sions@@ Rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of return was observed for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ t controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion diagnostic was superior in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until the maximum plasma catch is reached within 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular in 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ el cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks for 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times of mean steady state exposure at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times of mean steady @-@ state exposure to humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ad@@ state AU@@ C in the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
considering only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs was and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ anes across the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose in the subsequent series should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
with sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adap@@ tations in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on in@@ security and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes .
while a carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not proven , cardiac In@@ ci@@ dents in the index@@ ed patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if they occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ pation .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against the treatment of sperm @-@ preservation because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ anes can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the transport capability and the ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and important incidents of side @-@ effects observed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain of g@@ ums , loose stools , ec@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , stro@@ kes , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness , Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the amalg@@ amation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tub@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ activity and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ co@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ mare receptor and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two mon@@ oton@@ ous un@@ related studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for sounding bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute ker@@ fs of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75@@ mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure level exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or binding binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma the mean for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the total dose of less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ ised medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , the sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pipe bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid material .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is performed .
if precip@@ itation or sm@@ el@@ ting is visible , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently in order to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension prior to application .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood flow values in which a blood trans@@ fusion could occur if a blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with waste amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or if they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment to ensure that lack of iron and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ tis deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that it em@@ powers to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared in a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared with the reference resin .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either renamed to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin inj@@ ected under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed were kept in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ Cryp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
amed amed cannot be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are caused .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence , it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures se@@ amed will provide information packages to medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission approved Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG obtaining approval for the placing of Ab@@ s@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) in case blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
the reduction of foreign blood can be applied to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients in which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ aes@@ thesia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels can occasionally be observed over or below ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentrations .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest allowed dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher conservation doses than patients with less sever@@ ity of initial an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher conservation doses than patients with less sever@@ ity of initial an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest allowed dose , which is required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood @-@ cann@@ ed is required , should be received in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgical intervention .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ last@@ y ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are provided for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , es@@ cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently a heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ last@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ ular value should be determined and the common causes for non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium tox@@ i@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the re@@ tic@@ ular value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ y@@ oc@@ ytes ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ co@@ cy@@ te figures are normal , and if no other cause of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be assessed for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the administration of epo@@ e@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms and preventing blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ary cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the current findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ duc@@ ed ) .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic procedure , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated as soon as possible before the on@@ set of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular disease , especially in case of underlying car@@ dio @-@ vascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al value of &gt; 13 g / dl , there may be an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ e@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .

if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumour tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , ane@@ ur@@ y@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vascular happ@@ enings ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ ded and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ tigen patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mort@@ ality rate compared to the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in control .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ al value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

the holder of approval for the placing of the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system listed in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system has been launched before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in traffic .
the holder of the permit for placing on the market is oblig@@ ated to carry out the studies and additional measures listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and according to each subsequent update of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be made available to the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ o@@ dic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for human use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • If new information has been received , the impact on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures could be reached within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or a stroke prior to your treatment • if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first appearing or increased chest pain ) - if you have already performed such a drop of blood in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis )
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial vascular disease ) , the vascular disease ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it may occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ produces further treatment .
your doctor will perform regular blood tests if necessary in order to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with sever@@ s before starting treatment .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia , it will stop your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated due to an an@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with waste amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney damage and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age signs by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the current findings , the treatment of the blood arm with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and the desired effect should be taken into account for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine the red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your designated dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or lung em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in case you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ s@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative influence on the tumour under certain circumstances .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , before the treatment begins , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood @-@ dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of setting up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of treatment and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , you can learn when your doctor holds this for appropriate , also learn how to sp@@ lash the amed herself underneath the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( ane@@ ur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys have been reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( qu@@ in@@ ck oil ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ op@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying ab@@ se@@ amed is needed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with se@@ amed - to a blood gra@@ ft ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be accompanied by an increased risk of blood pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) when your starting point is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed you are considerably impaired or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a lower traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture like in the inf@@ low ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of ac@@ last@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data is used for z@@ omet@@ a to evaluate ac@@ last@@ a .
the first study included nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2,@@ 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies in 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % from the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % for patients under Ac@@ last@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to patients taking ac@@ last@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ last@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients taking placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of Ac@@ last@@ a &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ last@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ osis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ last@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ last@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to apply the medicine , and similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ last@@ a in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Dis@@ placement in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year to treat post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the treatment of ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 since data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ a@@ emia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid to the bone structure , a temporary , occasionally sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ last@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured every year prior to administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of application was observed at 1.8 % of the patients treated with Ac@@ last@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the patient &apos;s disease pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion body , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area became common mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ or@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ last@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in case of over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The effectiveness and safety of ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing tor@@ so frac@@ ture .
effects on the morph@@ ometric morph@@ ometric curves of Ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new tor@@ so frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients from 75 years of age and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal cord frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ yl@@ a hip frac@@ tures showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ last@@ a increased bone density in lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ al neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ opor@@ osis In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic base after the third annual dose .
in comparison with placebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the trab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone volume compared to placebo .
bone replac@@ ements The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of ac@@ last@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ( oral or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the placebo @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BM@@ D to the overall frac@@ tures and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all times .
for more than 24 months , the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of ac@@ last@@ a compared to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate related to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D was not inferior to the bas@@ eline value after 24 months .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in the treatment of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients with radi@@ ologically @-@ proven , above all light to moderate hom@@ bus pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron once daily during 2 months was detected in two six month comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for ac@@ last@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month trial were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron , the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a could be maintained in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months following the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma gas reached &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ alpha disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long phase of elimination with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al lifetime t ½ g 146 hours .
the early phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the oc@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances from cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , hydrogen @-@ inter@@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid .
as for severe kidney dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs studies , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referred to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent findings in repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tic effect of the substance .
in rats , a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity had been pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels .

in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no consistent results showed that the effects of compli@@ a in this field of application were difficult to assess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? he The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
it may not be applied in patients who suffer from an existing serious depression or are treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants as it can reinforce the risk of depression and , among other things , cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ ur@@ ment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly over@@ weight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly over@@ weight patients ) which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl substance or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ lic resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos in the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin have lowered the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stim@@ uli ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos will be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited the approval of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is in@@ appropriate for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in the reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with elevated levels of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are pre@@ valent .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention .
a slight reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment was reported using thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a presence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but rep@@ utable physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a if patients report on disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthal@@ m@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment should be ab@@ used ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies for the study of interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ free insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother @-@ animal decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were often compared with placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ate .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch it was rarely reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures in random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with comparative medications .
over a period of 3.5 years running Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral amount of glucose in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide was continued over two years in order to examine the time until the therapeutic effect is reduced ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequately terminated with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as mild , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ m@@ yo@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was detected , while values decreased in met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the shy tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels increased post@@ pran@@ dial , this both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo for up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV equals the effectiveness in roughly the three @-@ fold effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral use of radioactive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the rot@@ ten@@ fold ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination period of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with ha@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and re@@ versi@@ bly ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ es .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin @-@ free insulin and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ ine decreased and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder were induced .
in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1,1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .
in a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ de were investigated .
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in al@@ bum@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the shy tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels increased post@@ pran@@ dial , this both with an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was missing the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ killing m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative study .

Ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that blood sugar levels were reduced similarly to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ans may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is included in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S the approval of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly for example by intensified insulin therapy can detect the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ ologically active , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA from insulin in animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to ac@@ tra@@ phi@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which are going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the doctor &apos;s advice , as such travels may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients always for other medicines that they have taken .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can however be progres@@ sively developed : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supplements of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice in themselves . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a weigh@@ ted aid or given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum working maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ formation of crystals , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic can still use other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for a year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was under 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who received 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients , who once daily took 120 mg once a day , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in pla@@ que deposits ( including one of the medical records known or currently present g@@ out nodes and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , treatment with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ based medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to acute g@@ out due to the reduction of the serum arsen@@ ic acid first to mobili@@ se ure@@ c acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases occurs so far that it occurs in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before commen@@ cement of the f@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ ones has not been carried out at F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
at subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .

in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide contains , the absorption of f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delays and a decline of the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
experimental studies do not include direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ gruppe in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all the treatment groups , are listed below .
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are simultaneously treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In the clinical trials , no severe skin failures or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the events related to long @-@ term renewal studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ lin@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to the information occasionally .

clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of the proportion of patients with the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of serum arsen@@ ic acid to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor visit in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl get 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function ( ie .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC reached the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease in serum acid concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum hard acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum res@@ ine acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the long @-@ term reduction of serum arsen@@ ic acid levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against poison gas ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the g@@ out node size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the top notes until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased by dosage of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ lin@@ o@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage reduction of serum res@@ ins was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ lin@@ o@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma extinction of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ecraft is created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ ed f@@ eb@@ lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , about 45 % of the dose in the chair ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) found themselves again .
special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took around 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ of the h / ml in group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ y / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that fung@@ us ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately in the 4 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied with a decrease in breeding performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the Company presented data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only took al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing problems ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as aci@@ dic b@@ ump@@ ing .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE cannot be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components .
it must not be used in es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is possible . • The patients should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .

es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to relieve the medicine in case of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or a new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , or to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side @-@ effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to use it following the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapeutic regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ously bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available which indicates whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the designated week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE treatment begins .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
nevertheless , absorption of serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in@@ let of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al secre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al ac@@ ia may lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

after 15 @-@ week treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) as in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / l &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .

the effects of aging dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the Fra@@ ktur Inter@@ ven@@ tional Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dra , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients suffered from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the An@@ sti@@ ege of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ one 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
following the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , so it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .

ex@@ cre@@ tion The average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine after 48 hours of 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days was 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is ex@@ cre@@ ted quickly over the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is given adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , comparing the use of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a restart of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investigated how Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , head@@ ache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ cal@@ emia ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f as the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sel with &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level requirements ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations )
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , adapting the Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f can @-@ scheme may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t prevention of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initi@@ ating dose in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , which are switched to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and col@@ t transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood vessels in the desired area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum incre@@ mental level , a calculation of the cre@@ atine in@@ contin@@ ence and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ base levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be insp@@ ected after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustments , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances which could alter the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with low clearance , the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in full blood lie in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has lead to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adults and transplan@@ ts in childhood .
due to potential interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary level in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided or other plant remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ous skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f contain hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ary blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the metabolism of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially l@@ essen the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ born infants , i.e. :

in the following , side effects are listed according to their incidence in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( not estimated on the basis of available data ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which frequently increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level should medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this results in a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells , dependent on T cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who had undergone pancre@@ atic transplantation and were used in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f included in these published studies the observations in the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
also a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate of one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ dor@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were transferred from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
a multic@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously treated as a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ized procedure called Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml to 5 .
the published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after col@@ on transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ ching enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us leading to valley reflected between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recent transplantation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 4@@ 04 ) .
factors such as a low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism , caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients ( once daily ) in relation to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy .

other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ loading and e@@ dem@@ a .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ates are used to treat hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A are suffering from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into the formation of the human factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ tic episodes was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; evaluated .
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
advances may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the promotion of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve various in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ value periods .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. can be given by factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not ruled , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the speed of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
in the largest number of patients , A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rarely ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed adequate values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected .
in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend and a persist@@ ing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but no signs or symptoms indicated in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the framework of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE reports about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ io reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a C@@ of@@ ak@@ tor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

based on the data available since its initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for the approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects other structures in the body surrounds and supports ) of it .
it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ defect in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ance can be established in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated .
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the symptoms of the hay fever , which were reported by the patients before the treatment commen@@ ced and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all the symptoms of hypo@@ cris@@ y except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients who took Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ ph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth @-@ drying , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) or an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking them , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to lack of data for un@@ objec@@ tivity and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
following decline in the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver failure and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients need to be informed that treatment in the presence of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ ache ) must be de@@ posed .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ d@@ om@@ os@@ pas@@ m or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be stopped at least 48 hours before the mat@@ ological tests are carried out since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not in@@ hibit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed ; experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , it should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in a di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential le@@ thal processes .
head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , vom@@ iting , pre@@ corro@@ sive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , as@@ tax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as are at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( oral drying , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ crip@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were taken with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total live scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 weeks treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ groups according to sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers for 14 days , the floating equivalent of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly mixed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure after offering an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ity studies , the combination of lau@@ rel and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
the pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application procedure is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and watering or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of the bo@@ unc@@ ing medicine pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck closure , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ men in the medical history ( short@@ ness due to a conv@@ ul@@ sion of lung muscul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you can experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases in the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Heart hunting , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ ache , or strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
transport and handling of machines When used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed will be considerably impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , it was very rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whist@@ ling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disturbances , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal or allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of di@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been ab@@ duc@@ ted and res@@ um@@ ed at their re @-@ appearance .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the period of allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not as@@ cer@@ tained in clinical studies with Des@@ crip@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction of alcohol was not enhanced while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dro@@ ught ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45@@ mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the Ad@@ hesi@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ecular P @-@ selection on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , which was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which di@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ crip@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total live of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the bur@@ dening caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms and can be easily recru@@ ited by chronic patients .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in addition to chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ itus and reducing the size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the it@@ ching of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with the treatment of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients were compared with the general seas@@ on@@ ally allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in@@ hi@@ bits in vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of the meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ ber doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and find a higher substance burden ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are severely metaboli@@ zed is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance reduction of alcohol was not enhanced while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose showed 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years old , who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily tri@@ chlor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the child population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which di@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was noted at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or in adults and adolescents in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not lead to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power impair@@ ment or increased drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and young patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total live of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seas@@ on@@ ally allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pre@@ itus and reducing the size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are severely metaboli@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a half @-@ life time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the C@@ MA@@ x and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were compared with those of adults who received the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of di@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the sy@@ rup and the placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ a for the en@@ rol@@ ment formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ crip@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) , and in black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adults 2 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose cross @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years that are severely metaboli@@ zed is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , which is why patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months the most common adverse events that were reported more often than in placebo were diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 were observed in a single dose of 2.5 mg of the di@@ chlor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable to children &apos;s and adult population .

a pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influ@@ enza virus in the vaccine as &quot; alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to develop antibodies faster in case of contact with an influ@@ enza virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as a foreign matter ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being used to address the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is directed to the body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in blood while taking in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs and keeps them at a low level .
aids not cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
A@@ gener@@ ase , which was fortified with low dose , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only responded very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients with previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
aspir@@ ations should also not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as well removed as aspir@@ ations and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase risk a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a Oste@@ on@@ osis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the recovered immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors over@@ weigh@@ ed HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
normally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar twice daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boost ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ per@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for un@@ objec@@ tivity and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver failure , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
it should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ cycl@@ ine 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the in@@ gest@@ ing of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ations does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
normally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective due to reduced plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ oration of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an expression of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases where medications were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
in the event of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ cycl@@ ine 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines whose active substances are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ ar mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and replace the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ ar ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
5@@ 08 % elevated , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the bio@@ cide component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the administration of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is recommended since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine might be less effective due to the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole performed once a day led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tors may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous use of anti conv@@ ul@@ vul@@ va , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
con@@ current with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations considerably and intensi@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral bi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while being careful with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose can be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while offering A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk lac@@ ti@@ sing rats , am@@ pren@@ ar @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passing humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ fusion in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight in offspring .
the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernal animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to the outbreak of treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by investig@@ ators as in connection with study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of patients , and laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) were performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ ic fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s were treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes usually were mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or lean pap@@ ule nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ osis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable ; an exception were elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were received in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ened treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 occurred , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those of adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and their extension of AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ ar / 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were observed in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ ar / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
clin@@ ically vali@@ dated ph@@ onic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ ar / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses not pre @-@ treated patients ( one of which showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at treatment beginning and another against Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ dan@@ elles ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dop@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared with the time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients pre @-@ treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ations should be considered in the improvement of therapy with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ ar 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of blood stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ ar which represents the active portion is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the medicine that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily pren@@ atal exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ compatible than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar twice a day without simultaneous dosing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from these exposure data to people , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , am@@ pren@@ ar was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
in clinical trials , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dos@@ ages in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ze ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with minor or minor liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver failure , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % elevated , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved with the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is given twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ alg@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .

in a clinical study where 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ ar by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the in@@ fusion in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the weight of the offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is able to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0,@@ 0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; aspir@@ ations should be taken into account during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , the medicine that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can indu@@ ce or in@@ hibit or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .

the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there is little evidence for the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data of the human being , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , am@@ pren@@ ar was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality both in the control and with the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism channels are not fully mature in juven@@ ation , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake was not proven with pre @-@ treated patients with pre @-@ treated patients or pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ ar / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ ar which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase Solution can be given for intake and low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dosing may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side @-@ effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of preventing HIV from transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available for determination of the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be suspended if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as a higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
5@@ 08 % elevated , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
con@@ current with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase its plasma concentrations considerably and lead with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inhal@@ e may not be used during pregnancy due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
in milk lac@@ ti@@ sing rats , am@@ pren@@ ar @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passing humans into breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the in@@ fusion in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of the 55 body weight in the offspring .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages were observed - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ened treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early abor@@ tion of a 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which may have a detri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ations should be taken into account during therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of case war@@ ts in the genital area , the cream should be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
apply the cream before bed@@ time and apply to the affected areas of the skin so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about 8 hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active substance ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete rejection rate in all four major studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is continued until all visible cow@@ ards have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
in case of follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only in@@ completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .

in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case associated with circumc@@ ision leading stro@@ kes .
when using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local irrit@@ ation was observed even in proper use , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous treatments for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and peri@@ anal area , no clinical experience has been found so far .

the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study point out that there is a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or the lip area within the lip .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ian ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .

the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een by the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream , it often came to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ting / abor@@ ate ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een by the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream was very often caused by severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and sc@@ ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cow@@ ards in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the total number of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients the cow@@ ards healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in five @-@ colour use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .

the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more .
a minimum systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were weigh@@ ted 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ day after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ z weight ; a study carried out for four months also resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in the painting of three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours in the application .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure .

the study was mainly concerned with the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be severely hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years of age was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ yn@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a prolonged period of inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be handled cau@@ ti@@ ously after the treatment has been interrupted .
treat 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ics ) to minimize the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ amo@@ l / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exposed to larv@@ ae col@@ on over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly referred to as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years , are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe complic@@ ation and a duration of treatment of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .

most patients showed a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the treatment commen@@ ced , with patients aged under 5 years of age with a severe trial period ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , there were no det@@ ectable antibodies for 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom there was never a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ yn@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute side@@ walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the Plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in view of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation of the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes were taken across across five efficacy variables ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the medium term shape ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the medium follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate while only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected in older patients .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute side@@ walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those affected in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a one @-@ off dose , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data om@@ its no particular danger to humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( malign@@ ant ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • more advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , should be given a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , de@@ posed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of active life in cancer cells .
in the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study to 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , showed longer survival times than with the comparison drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each nozzle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with metastatic or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be taken at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid and intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dosage examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding h@@ opping treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ induc@@ t@@ onia an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 years old or over 65 years of age have an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on in@@ security and efficacy .
in clinical trials patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to adjust the dose adap@@ tations that go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold the upper limit value ( if liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone markers and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have returned a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dosage of dose for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ ached when pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients undergoing treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these occur@@ ren@@ ces had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible fo@@ aming of the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised against the treatment G@@ inn to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised that high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - res an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised against the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three single p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ estu@@ dies , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase of al@@ anine ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead back to differences in the patient population , as the pha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

clinical trials sometimes reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
it was reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting the metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ sp@@ as@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ follow@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ uc@@ cle@@ oti@@ d for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and purple @-@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ded patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only covered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in comparison with the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy reached a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the overall survival was in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.2 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the aggregate population statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ inferior margin of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transform@@ ations ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed after administration as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is ex@@ cre@@ ted mainly in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the dose administered will be found unchanged in urine within 24 hours of application .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ tion ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metaboli@@ se some fats in the diet , thereby causing about a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ds , bow@@ string , fet@@ al / o@@ ily chair , ab@@ duct o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rep@@ ul@@ sion in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or in cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast @-@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minimal res@@ or@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • S@@ lac@@ tation ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who are taking a medicine against diabetes should consult with all@@ i a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic must be adapted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( International Nor@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in the a@@ mic@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed .
experimental studies showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the incidence of adverse events detected after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of in@@ certain size .
† This is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported either no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of any systemic effects caused by the lying properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ous li@@ po@@ ds .
clinical studies have derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin che@@ ated with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L Cholester@@ ins was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( starting value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference was the average change -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , which the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ ated dose was administered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ tone ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified which represented approximately 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ ular concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the pharmac@@ eu@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for obes@@ e adults over 18 years with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and cal@@ orie @-@ reduced diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or over@@ weight in relation to your height .
even if these diseases do not initially cause you to feel uncomfortable , however , you should ask your doctor for a control examination .
for each 2 kg body weight you lose as part of a diet , you can lose one kilogram with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood th@@ inning effect .

ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
for more information on the blue pages in Section 6 , see further helpful information on how to set up your cal@@ orie and fat boundaries .
if you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only act when the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start before first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fatty diet .
nutritional books are effective because you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
in order to safely reach your target weight , you should define two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Di@@ et o@@ ily in order to reduce the likel@@ ihood of dietary defici@@ encies ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not accustomed to physical activity .
• It may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you cannot determine any reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of application , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it &apos;s not about changing your diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed will be considerably impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules and result in more fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment start as you may have not yet consistently reduced fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related symptoms : • Start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a full @-@ sized table , as you may have done with other programs for weight loss . • Most people in which these symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adapting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep the medicine for children in@@ accessible . • Do not use more than 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ oules , which you can also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the amount for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the effect of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional deficiency symptoms . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , which are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three major studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
chemotherapy regi@@ mens , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the issue of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids to chemotherapy given before chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ nesty in@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is required while offering pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five tested chemotherapy drugs against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clear@@ ance of Pal@@ e@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences relating to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron use in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects of a dose of 250 mc@@ g were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and di@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosing groups showed ; there were no dose @-@ action @-@ relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 100 mg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 mc@@ g. of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron who were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 .
results from studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ised in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average time @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are dose @-@ proportional in the entire dos@@ ages range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
following IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that at once daily IV administration of 0,@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days a total text position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with that after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which , compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as unchanged active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a single @-@ one intraven@@ ous injection of the whole body , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver failure have increased the termin@@ ale elim@@ inations time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence that Pal@@ e@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ul@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but because of the high dosage and since Alo@@ xi is determined for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is very low for humans .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of approval for the treatment of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is to resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( persistent ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are abnormal in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates it to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon laid out data confirming the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study for patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of reference to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment of the treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns that have caused the CH@@ MP to deny permission for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns were given to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side @-@ effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to assess the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not vali@@ dated adequately .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( bite or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn up wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or possibly caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hibit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin l@@ esi@@ ons , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin l@@ esi@@ ons , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go should out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn up wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin ( o@@ int@@ ment ) the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection is started .
retin@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration in the infected area after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections which Al@@ tar@@ go applied was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort @-@ tet@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ agon eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial patho@@ gen@@ ome that differenti@@ ates itself from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hibit the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al units .
should the local pre@@ valence of resistance reflect the use of retin@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were found in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic absorption in humans was a topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro review of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within the framework of a vacc@@ ination that exists out of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination that consists of two doses can end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the virus and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved since 1996 and the Twin@@ rix vaccine , which has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of one of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix caused a month following the last injection to the development of protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than one of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardis@@ ation plan for the pri@@ mor@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a ri@@ pen@@ ing compound is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured if immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with immune system disorders , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value is reached after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in cases of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneously since it can result in in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mas@@ h @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer salts and preser@@ vatives @-@ containing vacc@@ ines .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of subjects who had administered Ambi@@ rix over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % reported in the subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received the Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered for month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ ants ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ im@@ p @-@ substance significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination was demonstrated for people aged between 12 and 15 years old .
the immun@@ reaction against both anti@@ gens observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year was administered simultaneously with the formation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined m@@ um@@ ps @-@ m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum rates for the current formulation , as for earlier wording .
the vaccine is to be studied both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge lev@@ y is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized to this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus prior to administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the date of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be given .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin rash , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second in@@ oc@@ in@@ ox of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is spra@@ yed by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s immune system / is or if you / your child is undergoing a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take other medications ( including those that you can get without sp@@ elling ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / has received / has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
normally , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered , except it is urgent that they will be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 de@@ pressed doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ure • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefits risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was transferred only to a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ ica could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without a drug ) .
Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant odo@@ urs or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
Am@@ mon@@ ica was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission , only limited information was available for this medicine .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ born infants ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ fests after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ feste deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing problems as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us@@ ur@@ zer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a .
because metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and kidneys is carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed ri@@ pen@@ ing of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an un@@ desirable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of over@@ dosing occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity at intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ ry , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome .
the prog@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ born infants was almost always fatal , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was a 100 % survival rate , but even in these patients it was time for many people with intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to item , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following the intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary tract disorders or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was demonstr@@ able in the next morning at night fast no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine through the kidneys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pellets are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swal@@ low tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing problems ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ ake or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 @-@ 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early mani@@ feste deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if reed pipes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ) , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ am@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex occurred .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ex@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ omet@@ ry , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess oxygen
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure includes a small measuring spoon of 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large spo@@ on@@ ful 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , trace of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital in order to initiate appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ le ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose leading through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a hollow edge of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Stret@@ ch a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spo@@ ons corresponds to a measuring spoon .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measuring value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ ox@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared to conventional combined treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another antibody co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without administration of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other chemicals or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the market launch of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST disorder inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ ox@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure a cle@@ f of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bolt release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body@@ weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration by An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt @-@ dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt @-@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt @-@ dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after offering the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of ha@@ em@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another antibody ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the ble@@ ed@@ ings of arter@@ ial points occur in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can cause bleeding in the majority of cases .
in patients who take the war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , supervision of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again achieved before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it is assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 are more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scale for severe bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : extrac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , which required a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl with known bleeding area , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on the data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI therapy .
both in the bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din group and in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped together according to system classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately dis@@ car@@ ded and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific thy@@ mom@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ ine , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in on its part the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly spl@@ its , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was treated with serum from patients with an@@ thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c an@@ tic@@ ular anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following patients an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ira should be given and the in@@ fusion was increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the three treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an@@ gi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1 @-@ year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ dan@@ rel according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ized double blind study with over 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) are presented in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous correlation ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide contains a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism , resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by thro@@ mb@@ in , is not effective due to loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a temporal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated dose , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks for exposure to the 10 @-@ fold of the clinical Ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects resulting from a longer @-@ term physiological strain as response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to that in clinical use , even at very much higher dosage .

An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose cr@@ ush bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml , sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stop@@ per and sealed a cap of pressed aluminium .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a bottle of An@@ gi@@ ox and slightly swi@@ vel@@ ed until everything has dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 ml are taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glu@@ cos@@ al solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml bi@@ val@@ ira .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin or other constitu@@ ents , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneously with continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin demand in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( creator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in the insulin requirement .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in converting the treatment scheme .
the substances that can increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ contracting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tic drugs such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and reserve can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin swal@@ low@@ ly@@ s@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
listed below are listed by clinical trials known as un@@ desirable drug abuse , grouped by system organ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; not appreciated ( frequency based on the available data is not predictable ) .
cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , changes in vision , head@@ ache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is ed@@ ged to change the injection point in the injection area continuously , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose administered by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as through in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin shots and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine showed a dose of proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate rise in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was evident that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ pran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
for 2 minutes before the meal , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine was taken before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ di@@ al control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - uts before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin shots in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human North American insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
