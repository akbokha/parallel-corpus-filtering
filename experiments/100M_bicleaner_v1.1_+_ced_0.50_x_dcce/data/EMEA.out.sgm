<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report (EPAR), which discusses how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please refer to the package (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7,5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Several thinking and speaking, hallucinations (listening or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar I disturbance, a psychic condition in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of anorexic high spirits) alternately with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time, which are just as well as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted to Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between nerve cells among each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works as a "partial agony" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole behaves like 5-Hydroxytryptamin and Dopamine, but in a lower degree than neurotransmitters in order to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalizing the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased turmoil over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence in 160 patients where the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased turmoil, compared with the placebo (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patient was examined by means of a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhale.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased restlessness than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients as placebo for up to 74 weeks and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled swallowing), vomiting, somnolence (nausea), vomiting, nausea, restlessness, restlessness, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes continued to weigh on the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the issue of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and related their manic episodes to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviours belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering medicines) or hypertension (including accumulatory and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, occasional reports of dyskinesia arise during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients with Abilify treated patients signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events involving Abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics in which weight gain is known as a side effect and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, an gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reducers.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolizers can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reducers should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After removing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitors, Abilify dosage should be raised to the dosage height before beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromborphic / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethyst).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproduction studies, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned about using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - A controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of less incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Acathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients treated with Olant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients suffering from semi-surgery treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium therapy.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy have been reported to include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdose with Aripiprazole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma cell connection.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to histamine-H1 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Actual values from measurement scales, defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-DepressionsRate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of return was observed for Aripiprazole, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olant controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I disorder Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a efficacy in week 3 compared to placebo, which was comparable to that of lithium or semi-operated idol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Also in week 12, Aripiprazole showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxylozation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolizers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, nor did pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia do not show gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific study on pharmacokinetics showed no indications of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyel cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinse carcinomas and combined adrenal rinds in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1-3 times the medium Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16 to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human bile no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11x of the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical peak dose.</seg>

<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedentary was greater compared to that after every dose of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) was intramuscularly applied and at the same time lauazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, an gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolizers can result in common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reducers should be made.</seg>

<seg id="166">In another study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium therapy.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy have been reported to include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant stronger improvement in the symptoms of Agitibility and behavioural disturbances compared to placebo and similar to the Lorraine reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe Agititis, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who received a response to the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%.</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion diagnostic was superior in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of a bipolar response, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time until the maximum plasma catch is reached within 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were intramuscular in 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application, there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety macology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure at humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyel cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks for 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times of mean steady state exposure at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times of mean steady-state exposure to humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel medicines.</seg>

<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, ecophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, strokes, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness, Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules agent that promotes the amalgamation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interactivity and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcocytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 nightmare receptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two monotonous unrelated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxanes, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 than 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had not received chemotherapy before, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastazation and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for sounding baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute kerfs of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure level exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or binding binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma the mean for cumulative urination of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the total dose of less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">Only a few data are available for patients aged over 75 years, because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarised medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be taken care of when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, the sodium chloride infusion solution is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the pipe bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid material.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood flow values in which a blood transfusion could occur if a blood circulation is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with waste amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make haemorrhages, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor if they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are to be monitored before treatment to ensure that lack of iron and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoitis deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that it empowers to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared in a major study with 479 patients who suffered anaemia caused by kidney problems, compared with the reference resin.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either renamed to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the start of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin injected under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the haemoglobin values of patients who were switched to Abseamed were kept in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / ErCrypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Amed amed cannot be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that no allergic reactions are caused.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed, according to the provisions of the European Union of evidence, it was demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that manufactures seamed will provide information packages to medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission approved Medice medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG obtaining approval for the placing of Absamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) in case blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">The reduction of foreign blood can be applied to a large elective orthopedic procedure in adults with no iron deficiency in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except for pediatric patients in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaesthesia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and overall disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin levels can occasionally be observed over or below haemoglobin concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month, or if the permanent haemoglobin exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest allowed dose, which is required for controlling anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher conservation doses than patients with less severity of initial anaemia (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher conservation doses than patients with less severity of initial anaemia (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and overall disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest allowed dose, which is required for controlling anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment of the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl over the initial value, the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the reticular number of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared with the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg, the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticular number is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Reticulozyte count increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an approach to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood-canned is required, should be received in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgical intervention.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of autologous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with some erythropoetin in erythroblastoopia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastooplasty).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are provided for a larger elective orthopedic procedure and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escoronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently a heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastooplasty (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticular value should be determined and the common causes for non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxiation, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticular value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticuloyocytes), is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leucocyte figures are normal, and if no other cause of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow should be assessed for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating substances (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit derived from the administration of epoeins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling anemia symptoms and preventing blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidenary coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentrations should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the current findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In the case of tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-administration and erythropoetin response should be taken into account (patients who may need to be transduced).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of thrombotic occurrences (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for applying recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk reduction involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopedic procedure, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated as soon as possible before the onset of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disease, especially in case of underlying cardio-vascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobal value of &gt; 13 g / dl, there may be an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoeins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was striven</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels should be controlled by Ciclosporin and the Ciclosporindose should be adjusted to increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular attacks, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, cerebral thrombosis, aneurythrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular happenings (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically engineered epoetin alfa is glycoded and is identical with the amino acids and carbohydrate content with the endogenous human erythropoetin which was isolated from the urine of antigen patients.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes bone brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including those who have recently suffered a lower traumatic hip fracture like in the inflow; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (means of inflammation) shortly after the application of aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% from the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures was reduced by 70% for patients under Aclasta (without other osteoporosis) over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to patients taking aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients taking placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of Aclasta's side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to coledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • for postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg of aclasta is recommended once a year to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after surgical care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the treatment of aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended because limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for children and adolescents under the age of 18 since data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokaltsaemia should be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the treatment begins (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of coledron acid to the bone structure, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental interventions, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>

<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinine Clearance (measured every year prior to administration) and the occurrence of renal failure as well as a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days of application was observed at 1.8% of the patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium levels that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2,10 mmol / l) were compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the patient's disease paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion body, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area became common mainly in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zolorronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconat.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The effectiveness and safety of aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated for postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing torso fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on the morphometric morphometric curves of Aclasta significantly increased over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new torso fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients from 75 years of age and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal cord fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetyla hip fractures showed a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density in lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the femal neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteoporosis In 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic base after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison with placebo, a microcomputer tomographic (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabeculary bone volume compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacements The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. (oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the placebo-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased the BMD to the overall fractures and Schenkelhals at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">For more than 24 months, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% on the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of aclasta compared to the weekly administration of Alendronate related to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD was not inferior to the baseline value after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in the treatment of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients with radiologically-proven, above all light to moderate hombus paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron acid compared to taking 30 mg of Risedron once daily during 2 months was detected in two six month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for aclasta and risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month trial were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and the 107 patients treated with Risedron, the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with aclasta could be maintained in a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months following the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma gas reached &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid bialpha disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long phase of elimination with a terminale Eliminationshal lifetime t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The overall body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the ocoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances from cytochromium P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because Zoledron acid is not metabolized by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, hydrogen-interdependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinine-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to a creatinine Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe kidney dysfunction (creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letal effective intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs studies, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6x of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure referred to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred with other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings in repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, antiresortic effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, a teratogenicity of doses from 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity had been pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a substance class that is called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget's disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, mainly estrogen made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the Paget's Morbus Paget, the bone reconstruction takes place too quickly, and new bone material is structured unstructured, making the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and thus giving strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Beurment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations on the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) which cannot be satisfactorily set with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl harnant or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonylharnant or insulin can be maintained with the start of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl substance or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripleotherapy; in addition, the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonlic resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos in the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylharnate decreased by 0.94% while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin have lowered the HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in the patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos will be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited the approval of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is inappropriate for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in the reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated levels of liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are up to 3-fold the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be conducted by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are prevalent.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean haemoglobin (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1-2% and haematocrits by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl or dual combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment was reported using thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, a presence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but reputable physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report on disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1,1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment should be abused (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies for the study of interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a lowering of the AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-free insulin and increased insulin resistance of the mother-animal decreases and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege were often compared with placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylharnate.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazon or Pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it was rarely reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures in randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years running ProActive study, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days there were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral amount of glucose in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide was continued over two years in order to examine the time until the therapeutic effect is reduced (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequately terminated with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as mild, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmyoglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo in Pioglitazone no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was detected, while values decreased in metformin and gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the shy triglycerides but also improved triglyceride levels increased postprandial, this both with an effect on triglyceride levels as well as hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo for up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV equals the effectiveness in roughly the three-fold effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the rottenfold (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination period of unmodified pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with haemodilution, anaemia and reversibly eccentric heart hypertrophies.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin-free insulin and increased insulin resistance of the uterine decreased and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindiones led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin each with pioglitazone or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the shy triglycerides but also improved triglyceride levels increased postprandial, this both with an effect on the tryglycerid absorption and the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-killing myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union, the Company presented data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase of vitamin D.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) compared to those who only took alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsy (diarrhoea), ulcers (ulcera), oesophagus, dysphagia (swallowing problems), irritated abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as acidic bumping.</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side-effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to use it following the occurrence of symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, gastric and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft and data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, comparing the use of Advagraf with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or a restart of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant and investigated how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Tremor, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), kidney problems, increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia), diabetes, increased potassium content (hypercalemia), hypertension (hypertension) and insomnia (insomnia).</seg>
<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other components, Advagraf may not be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be careful when other (especially some herbal) medicines should be taken at the same time with Advagraf as the Advagraf dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1409">Hard capsules, retarded yellow-orange gel capsules, printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with "0.5 mg" and on the orange capsel with "647"; they contain white powder.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side-effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level requirements (see below "Recommendations)</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable with both formulations in both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus valley are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate re-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, adapting the Advagraf can-scheme may take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the patient's condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines, the Tacrolimus treatment can be intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0,20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments can be required later, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change in the course of stabilization of the patient after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prevention of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted to a transplant of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules at once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressive agents to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initiating dose in kidney and liver transplants must begin for the prevention of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients, which are switched to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there are no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colt transplanted patients, occurred in a oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0,15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For maintenance of blood vessels in the desired area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum incremental level, a calculation of the creatine incontinence and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of thoroughbred tacrolimus level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-base levels of Tacrolimus should also be inspected after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustments, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances which could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with low clearance, the dose can take several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood levels of Tacrolimus in full blood lie in the first time after liver transplants usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has lead to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur in a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; provisions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adults and transplants in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacroliary level in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) is to be avoided or other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, particularly careful monitoring of the Tacroliary concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligous skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking the Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advagraf contain hard capsules, retarded, lactose, special care is required in patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of Tacrolimus and therefore increase or decrease the blood levels of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacroliary blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the metabolism of the CYP3A and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with antimycotics like ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetical studies showed that the rise in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as the CYP3A4 inhibition; hence, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazon and prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma rot, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on a molecular level should mediate the effects of tacrolimus by binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This results in a calcium-dependent inhibition of signalling pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells, dependent on T cells, and the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1474">Renal transplantation The effectiveness and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, at 667 de novo renal transplant receivers.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patient survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97,5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in Prograf arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, at 638 de novo renal transplant receivers.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or lack of follow-up data) was 14.0% in the adult group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf- Ciclosporin) (95.2% CI) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (95.2% CI interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of twice daily prograf capsules after other primary organ transplantations Prograf has developed into a recognized primary immunosuppressant for pancreatic, lung and intestinal transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patient-transplanted patients, with 475 patients who had undergone pancreatic transplantation and were used in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf included in these published studies the observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Also a chronic graft rejection, the bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome, was less frequent in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate of one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolidor- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus it occurred in 21.7% of the cases for the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterans in comparison to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus (n = 0.02) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients that were transferred from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliteral syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentric trial with oral prograf was performed on 205 patients who were simultaneously treated as a pancreatic and kidney transplant following a randomized procedure called Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml to 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colon transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for the early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marching enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus leading to valley reflected between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recent transplantation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism, caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly carried out via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) on Advagraf (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients (once daily) in relation to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 to the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overloading and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraf group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advates are used to treat hemorrhages or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A are suffering from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA-technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into the formation of the human factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes was "excellent" or "good" evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advances may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"" "" "" "in March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the promotion of lawyers in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve various in vivo recovery and show different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A doses between 20 and 40 I.U. can be given by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding with an appropriate dose is not ruled, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The speed of administration should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins that are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and an amnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">In the largest number of patients, ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rarely (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rarely (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected decrease of the blood clotting factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the time and the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma as well as the Clearance rate showed adequate values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of a current clinical study 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a persisting peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but no signs or symptoms indicated in an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since its initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) to withdraw its application for the approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been changed in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced by the non-defect in the human body is normally used to restore damaged DNA and kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-Cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP will generate a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin's injection in Li-Fraumeni tumors brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advance can be established in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways) in patients with nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measurements were the changes in the severity of the symptoms of the hay fever, which were reported by the patients before the treatment commenced and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all the symptoms of hypocrisy except constipation of the nose, the patients who took Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudophedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took the desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth-drying, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension) or an hemorrhagic stroke (stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking them, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to lack of data for unobjectivity and efficacy (see section 5.1) Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following decline in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combination of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other decongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not examined for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver failure and the data is not sufficient to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment in the presence of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headache) must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, hydomospasm or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be stopped at least 48 hours before the matological tests are carried out since antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed; experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictor characteristics of pseudoephedrine, it should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can result in a dizziness, which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyansis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with potential lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, vomiting, precorrosive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, astaxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-typical symptoms (oral drying, pupil rigidity and dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the Adhesisionsmolecular P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Descripatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were taken with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total live scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucosal swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine about the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2 weeks treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient subgroups according to sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers for 14 days, the floating equivalent of desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the course of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were badly mixed.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposition (CMAx and AUC) of Pseudoephedrine after the sole gift of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was for exposure after offering an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicity studies, the combination of laurel and pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in doses of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">The pharmaceuvigilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the application procedure is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal or allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of paddles, impairment of sleep and performance on days) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urtikaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "" "" "in January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of dichloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the current course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have been abducted and resumed at their re-appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the period of allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not ascertained in clinical studies with Descripatadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction of alcohol was not enhanced while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth-drought (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of the patients treated with desloratadin and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study where up to 45mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the Adhesisionsmolecular P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, which was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which dichloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Descripatadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total live of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burdening caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar in the different forms and can be easily recruited by chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causal factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms even in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving preitus and reducing the size and number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the itching of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with the treatment of the loratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patients were compared with the general seasonally allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with desloratadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independent of the meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the diagnosis of anamnesis, physical examination and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise desloratadin and find a higher substance burden (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are severely metabolized is identical to that of children who are normally metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol, so patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not established in clinical trials using Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance reduction of alcohol was not enhanced while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the Aerius syrup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, the recommended dose showed 3% more side-effects in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years old, who were eligible for an anti-histamine therapy, received a daily trichloratadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the child population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which dichloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was noted at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single-day dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets led to no impairment of psychomotor in adults and adolescents in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not lead to a strengthening of alcohol-induced power impairment or increased drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and young patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the total live of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonally allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving preitus and reducing the size and number of paddles at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations bigger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are severely metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The burden (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a half-life time of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no clues for clinically relevant active substance cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the CMAx and CMAx values of desloratadin in pediatric patients were compared with those of adults who received the desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to approve Abounov's approval for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from humans to humans because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the parts of the influenza virus in the vaccine as "alien" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to develop antibodies faster in case of contact with an influenza virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which recognizes the human body as a foreign matter), was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has tested what antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken and the likelihood of the virus being used to address the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with 100 mg kritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is directed to the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV-amount in blood while taking in combination with other antiviral drugs and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids not cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two major studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Agenerase, which was fortified with low dose, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors only responded very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir to increase the viral load after four weeks compared to patients with previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Amalgavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aspirations should also not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are just as well removed as aspirations and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take Agenerase risk a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a Osteonosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovered immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat protease inhibitors overweighed HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Normally, Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic booths of Amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenar twice daily together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (boost), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenar which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amperase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for unobjectivity and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver failure, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">It should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also present the substrate of the cytochrome P450-Isocycline 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of Amprenavir during the ingesting of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aspirations does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Normally, Agenerase capsules should be used along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please refer to the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticosteroids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids, including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available for determination of the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective due to reduced plasma gas of Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycoloration of the Agenerase solution to intake, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set for 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an expression of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases where medications were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hämophiles patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in bleeding, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In the event of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is adopted (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isocycline 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with medicines whose active substances are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir may be degraded by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenar mirror and, if possible, check the viral load and replace the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary when nelfinavir is given together with Amprenar (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% elevated, for CMAx it is reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma that were achieved with the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir is given twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amalgavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine, but due to the biocide component of Didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the administration of Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is recommended since Delavirine might be less effective due to the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamprenar and 100 mg of ketoconazole performed once a day led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenar with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below including substrates, inhibitors or CYP3A4 Inductors may, if used together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida will not be taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it may result in resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti convulvulva, known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent with Agenerase can increase its plasma concentrations considerably and intensify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time as Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with oral bidazolam (see section 4.3) while being careful with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Midazolam around 3-4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with Amalgavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, as the amprenavir- dose can be adjusted if Amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while offering Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In milk lactising rats, amprenar-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether Amprenavir is passing humans into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the infusion in the uterus to the end of breastfeeding period, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight in offspring.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the maternal animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to the outbreak of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with taking Agenerase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), which were assessed by investigators as in connection with study medication, were performed in more than 1% of patients, and laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) were performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and differential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsozeric fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated at 245 NRTIs were treated with Amprenavir 7 cases (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes usually were mild to moderate, erythematous or lean papule nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of the introduction of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low dose Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable; an exception were elevated triglyceride and CPK values, which were received in patients who received Agenerase along with low dose of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is able to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range between 0,012 and 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment antiretroviral not pre-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages were observed - as with other ritonavir geboostened treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure up to week 48 occurred, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / M / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and their extension of APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenar / 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) patients treated with protease inhibitors were observed in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenar / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinically validated phonic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenar / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir Associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross-resistance to ritonavir, the sensitivity to Indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviruses not pre-treated patients (one of which showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at treatment beginning and another against Tipranavir), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early abortion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which may have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (Viruslast ≥ 1000 copies / ml) either Agenerase (100 mg twice daily) and nucleodanelles (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-doped Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir compared with the time-adjusted average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unborn Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was tested three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of Ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients pre-treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "unbleached" "" "aspirations should be considered in the improvement of therapy with PI pre-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (Tmax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx, by contrast, reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenar 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained uninfluenced by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of blood stream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of inbound Amprenar which represents the active portion is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of inbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total-drug concentration in the Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, the medicine that CYP3A4 can induce or inhibit or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenera capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily prenatal exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less biocompatible than the capsules; therefore, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>

<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amprenar.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From these exposure data to people, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations of human peripheral lymphocytes included, amprenar was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">In clinical trials, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of Ritonavir (booze), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenar / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenar which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous use should be treated with caution in patients with minor or minor liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver failure, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available for determination of the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin from Amprenar by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment with Imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although neither after one-off nor after several layers of topical application quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were reached, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimodine cream in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most frequent reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects include complaints at the site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalom patients treated with Imiquimodine cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimodine cream in relation to side effects were in these studies a reaction in the site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects listed by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimodine cream treated patients with actinent keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine cream, it often came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreting / aborate (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs foreseen by the test plan shows that in these studies, five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine cream was very often caused by severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and scrusting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of Imiquimodine for the treatment of actinent keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg of Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In pharmacokinetic investigations, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards in an imiquimod treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total number of patients with Imiquimod patients the cowards healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in five-colour use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superfictional basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertropic, non-hypertrophic active lesions within a connected 25 cm2 treatment area on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The biannual data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical hearing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications externally feignices, actinical keratose and superficially basal cell carcinoma do not generally occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinent keratose was observed in the three weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were weighted 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-day after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with actinent keratose or superficially basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg led to significantly reduced body weight and increased milz weight; a study carried out for four months also resulted in no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice in the painting of three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutated, it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors occurred in the group of mice that were treated with the toxic-free cream, earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara Cream as it is not known whether Imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">Frequency and duration of treatment vary in case of case warts, basal cell carcinoma and aktinical keratose (see specific instructions for each application).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara Cream onto the clean, dry skin with the cowards and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with cowards under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin below (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to develop a blue stain more quickly, or it may cause shredding.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects listed you can significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can experience itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which resound in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the site (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin irritation, blister, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the site (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, flu, or flu-like symptoms, depression, eye irritation, swelling of the eyelids, sore throat, diarrhea, ulcers, artery pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the treatment of enzymes in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharitin I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the movements complicate, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with rejuvenation devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was mainly concerned with the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be severely hypersensitive (allergic) to Laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known and update this summary whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should take place by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years of age was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any related side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalizing devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against larynidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a prolonged period of interruption, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions has to be handled cautiously after the treatment has been interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before the start of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyreics) to minimize the potential infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquine or Procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns that were exposed to larvae colon over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mainly referred to as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a duration of up to 4 years, are very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oil (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with predominantly severe complication and a duration of treatment of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients showed a seroconversion within 3 months after the treatment commenced, with patients aged under 5 years of age with a severe trial period (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study), there were no detectable antibodies for 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom there was never a Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was determined in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, larynase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study that showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute sidewalk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme every week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and the viability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the Placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute monary volumes increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment reached 22 (85%) up to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine) was established, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In view of the heterogeneous disease manifestation of the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes were taken across across five efficacy variables (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the medium term shape).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- mirror in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight increase (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group. the younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the medium follow-up form showed a normal mental development rate while only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected in older patients.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute sidewalk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those affected in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with a one-off dose, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data omits no particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, should be given a "antiemetic" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, deposed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration of active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study to 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, showed longer survival times than with the comparison drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to approve Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each nozzle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with metastatic or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed administration and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift - including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dosage examination must take place taking account of the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the preceding hopping treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients do not develop hematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if in patients after 2 dose-inductonia an hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity Grade 3 or 4 occurs or so on at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that patients aged 65 years old or over 65 years of age have an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on insecurity and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials patients with a creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to adjust the dose adaptations that go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (if liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold the upper limit value (if liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone markers and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils have returned a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet number again has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dosage of dose for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity as observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was beached when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (creatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous consumption of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsalic- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients undergoing treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-time for at least 5 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these occurrences had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, drainage of the effusion should be considered before the pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic drug.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible foaming of the reproductive capacity is due to pemetrexed, men should be advised against the treatment Ginn to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to reduced pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised that high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses can be used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- res antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy, except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to pemetrexed, men should be advised against the beginning of treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfeeding infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised Cisplatin and Pemetrexed, and 163 patients with Mesothelioma who were randomized to Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients treated before, during or after their pemetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate that exerts its effect by interrupting the metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with multiple targets by blocking the thymidyspasthase (TS), Dihydrofollowatreduktase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonuccleotid for- myltransferase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purple-cleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomized, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaided patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month prolonged survival compared to those patients who were only covered with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in comparison with the sole Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms were improved by improving the pulmonary function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss could be observed for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily stains at the anus, flatus (winch) with studs, bowstring, fetal / oily chair, abduct oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who are taking a medicine against diabetes should consult with alli a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy because the dosage of antidiabetic must be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and iclosporin, a reduction of the iclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (International Norised ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease in the amicodarone plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Experimental studies showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal adverse events were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events detected after the launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of incertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† This is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the reported cases of orlistat overdose reported either no side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid reformation of any systemic effects caused by the lying properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine-rest of the gastric and pankreous lipods.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypotheorical, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants that have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in Gesamtcholesterin cheated with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (output value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (output value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL Cholesterins was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline value 3,30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (starting value 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference was the average change -4,5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients, which the minimal systemic resorbiated dose was administered, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactone ring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-shaped leucine group), were identified which represented approximately 42% of the total plasmacular concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2571">If you leave a meal or a meal does not contain fat, do not take a capsule. alli can only act when the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat, you risk nutritional supplements (see section 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">To get used to the new eating habits, start before first capsule intake with a calorie and fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Nutritional books are effective because you can understand what you eat, how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits.</seg>
<seg id="2575">In order to safely reach your target weight, you should define two daily goals in advance: one for the calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Diet oily in order to reduce the likelihood of dietary deficiencies (see section 4). • Try to move more before you start taking the capsules.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules and result in more fat being excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of the treatment start as you may have not yet consistently reduced fat content in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize diet-related symptoms: • Start a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood you will exceed your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a full-sized table, as you may have done with other programs for weight loss. • Most people in which these symptoms occur, learn to control these with time by adapting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep the medicine for children inaccessible. • Do not use more than 25 ° C. • Keep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture. • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with silica gel, which serve to keep the capsules dry.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy, which are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicine, or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an antiemetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three major studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">Chemotherapy regimens, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting showed 59% of patients treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of patients treated with Aloxi in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the issue of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy because of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a Corticosteroids to chemotherapy given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty instipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is required while offering palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five tested chemotherapy drugs against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicine) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Cimetidine, Doxorubicine, Fluoxetine, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Paleosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences relating to palonosetron use in human pregnancies are not present, therefore palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects of a dose of 250 mcg were observed (a total of 633 patients), who were at least associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and distipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the site (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosing groups showed; there were no dose-action-relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for Aloxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 100 mg of dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study a total of 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin and 250 or 750 mcg. of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of Ondansetron who were given intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results from studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The study carried out at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average time-time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are dose-proportional in the entire dosages range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following IV administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily IV administration of 0,25 mg palonosetron on 3 consecutive days a total text position (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with that after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg measured; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unchanged active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single-one intravenous injection of the whole body, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver failure have increased the terminale eliminations time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies evidence that Paleosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repularization and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in approximately the 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased incidence of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but because of the high dosage and since Aloxi is determined for one-time application, the relevance of these results is very low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the approval of approval for the treatment of the medicines intended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon is to resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medicinal effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicine" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (persistent) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage, furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are abnormal in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon laid out data confirming the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study for patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of reference to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment of the treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were given to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease rose again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; in addition, Alpheon had more side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to assess the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not validated adequately.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirmations (bite or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn up wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or possibly caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients aged nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin lesions, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin lesions, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo should outweigh the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or sewn up wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitizing or serious local irritation by applying reapamulin (ointment) the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration in the infected area after a 2-3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on skewed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are not considered necessary when topical reapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the application of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections which Altargo applied was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from Clitopilus passwort-tetanus (formerly pleurotus passagon erianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of reapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial pathogenome that differentiates itself from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the PeptidylTransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance reflect the use of retinamulin at least some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were found in the in-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and striped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic absorption in humans was a topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skewed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats micro-core test for in-vivo-study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skewed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental oxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area show, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not use other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless prescribed by your doctor specifically.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within the framework of a vaccination that exists out of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination that consists of two doses can end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body)" "" "how it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the virus and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the Vaccine Twinrix adults, which has been approved since 1996 and the Twinrix vaccine, which has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of one of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix caused a month following the last injection to the development of protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than one of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maternity (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the marketing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the primorisation with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a ripening compound is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or with a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A-Virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured if immunocompetent individuals who responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination need vaccination as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with immune system disorders, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value is reached after priming, so that in these cases the administration of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal result in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In cases of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously since it can result in intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mash-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in earlier thiomer salts and preservatives-containing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccination doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and maturation on a calculation basis per Vaccine dose of Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of subjects who had administered Ambirix over pain, compared to 63.8% reported in the subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle of 39.6% of subjects who received the Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and maturation was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dosed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B and surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The serum rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered for month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotectants (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose-imp-substance significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which was achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination was demonstrated for people aged between 12 and 15 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction against both antigens observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study from 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year was administered simultaneously with the formation of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mumps-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar serum and serum rates for the current formulation, as for earlier wording.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be studied both before and after the resusension on possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus prior to administration of both vaccines Ambirix (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the date of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rash, breathing or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inocinox of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since issuance of the first permit for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefits risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was transferred only to a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammontaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammontaps - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach's leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study because Ammonica could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without a drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammontaps can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant odours or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammontaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonica was approved under "exceptional circumstances," due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission, only limited information was available for this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborn infants (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first month of life), there is an indication for the use of hyperammonia encephalopathy in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyate: • 450-600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifeste deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing problems as there is a risk for the formation of esophagusurzera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Because metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and kidneys is carried out, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed ripening of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdosing occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity at intravenous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichiometry, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phenylbutyate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborn infants was almost always fatal, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hematalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was a 100% survival rate, but even in these patients it was time for many people with intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithinbamylase deficiency), which recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis according to item, as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following the intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary tract disorders or haemoglobin, phenylbutyat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was demonstrable in the next morning at night fast no phenylacetate in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyat was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS pellets are either taken orally (babies and children who cannot swallow tablets or patients with swallowing problems) or a gastrostomiake or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450-600 mg / kg / day in infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifeste deficiency of Carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithinbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If reed pipes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyate), lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorexic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate, severe hypokalemia, armytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichiometry, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess oxygen</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, phenylbutyate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure includes a small measuring spoon of 0.95 g, the mean measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large spoonful 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must notify the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress lift" (an anomalous measuring value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If anoxox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain the blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole administration or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared to conventional combined treatment with Heparin (another antibody coagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots like abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">Treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without administration of GPI - in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was just as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other chemicals or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a hemorrhage, as well as people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted The Medicines Company UK Ltd a permit for the market launch of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST disorder infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of anoxox in patients with ACS is an intravenous intake of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a clef of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolt release of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg bodyweight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration by Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt-dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt-dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt-dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate-severe kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after offering the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous administration of unquestionable heparin or 8 hours after termination of the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disorder of haemostatic system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another antibody (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the bleedings of arterial points occur in the case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can cause bleeding in the majority of cases.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take the warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, supervision of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivalirudin is again achieved before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or Thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it is assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalerudin with platelet aggregations or anticoagulants, clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, bandaging or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalerudin group and in patients treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 are more likely to suffer adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi scale for severe bleeding, as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: extracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, which required a radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with diameter ≥ 5 g / dl with known bleeding area, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localisations that occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on the data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalerudin group and in patients treated with heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped together according to system classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, treatment with bivalirudin is immediately discarded and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific thymominhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thrombine is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to thrombine, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because thrombin on its part the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly splits, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin was treated with serum from patients with anthrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentric anticular anticoagulatory effect which is confirmed by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following patients an additional bolt of 0,5mg / kg of bivalira should be given and the infusion was increased to 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were spread evenly across the three treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1-year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidanrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-days and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidanrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients receiving aspirin and Clopidanrel according to protocol were Arm A Arm B Arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIIb / IIIa + GPIIb / IIIa risk Diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleeding both in the ACUITY- and Timi-level up to Day 30 for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidanrel according to protocol is shown in table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">According to protocol UFH / Enox Bival Bival UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + alone + + GPIIb / IIIa GPIIb / IIIa (N = 2911)% (N = 2924)% (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopdogrel against angiography or prior to PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of hemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with over 6,000 patients who underwent a PCI (REPLACE-2) are presented in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients who underwent a percutaneous correlation (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as peptide contains a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism, resulting from the split of the ARG3 Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by thrombin, is not effective due to loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a temporal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity with repeated dose, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks for exposure to the 10-fold of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects resulting from a longer-term physiological strain as response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to that in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the production of the ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose crush bottles of type 1 glass to 10 ml, sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed a cap of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a bottle of Angiox and slightly swiveled until everything has dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the water bottle and diluted with 5% glucosal solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml bivalira.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The holder of approval for placing on the market agrees to conduct studies and pharmacovigilance activities listed in the Pharmakovigilance Plan, as agreed in version 4 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and to carry out any follow-up changes of the RMP approved by CHMP.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years of age with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or that insulin cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisine differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot be processed effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin or other constituents, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneously with continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin demand in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (creator), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method may result in a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in converting the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that can increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin-contracting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, diopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympatholytic drugs such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserve can be weakened or absent from the symptoms of the adrenergic counterregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin swallowlysine occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed by clinical trials known as undesirable drug abuse, grouped by system organ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; not appreciated (frequency based on the available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is edged to change the injection point in the injection area continuously, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous glucose administered by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as through inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with subcutaneous ga- be of insulin shots and the duration of active insulin is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin-lulisine showed a dose of proportionate glucosal effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate rise in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandiale glycaemic control is reached as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For 2 minutes before the meal, insulin-lulisine was taken before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved, as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- uts before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin shots in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - previously) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisine in gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human North American insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
