if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the location of the whole &amp; URL ;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make any important decisions , without checking the translation before .
only websites on the web can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert translated texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which are easier to use .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose settings extensions .... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras crash . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete .
the Query Filter module ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras requirements filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in a variety of ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View is to present ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les possess meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over View Color Mode can either show depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of sub @-@ or@@ derly rectang@@ les occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tangle .
in case of Tre@@ em@@ aps for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . there are frames drawn to avoid the ne@@ sting of entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ tangle is square .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is necessary for labelling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames always advantageous to divide the areas so that rectang@@ les are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu item View stop at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .

with the view box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
click on the image size check@@ box to see if the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the folder folder , specify where the gallery is saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder you can set up with a slider or a script , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images to the gallery to copy the original images to the gallery .
using the comment file box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be set here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; together .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE image plug@@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
this opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you are using these links , your web browser will open a page in the fault reporting system . all the information you need is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; however , you may soon answer questions of other users themselves . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ ti@@ tes ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announc@@ ing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or removable folder . just enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will also be used as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am setup collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; see every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Dur@@ seeks recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders , unless it is in hidden folders . you can do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album symbol .
once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up your digital camera in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Work@@ flows .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission .
digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support for reliably reading the thumb@@ nails from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed is how easy it can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; themselves perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ lt , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view . so the filtering on the filen@@ ame only works if this ind is displayed as a symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Setup dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was first created .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . just select Album Import Pictures . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to share information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to highlight your albums , so that you can group them under a common name . the collection you used will be used to sort your photos by selecting collection from the tool@@ bars or sorting pictures by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date sort .
the Buttons El@@ der , average , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed , the first picture in the album will be shown as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , choose . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections can not be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons on the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the respective preview . what information these are , you can change over Settings digi@@ ti@@ pped ; set up the albums page and customize the preview area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have auxiliary windows , which appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all , what it is about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose any functions that are with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the pictures .
you can open image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or edit the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select . in the editing section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the application from the sub @-@ menu of opening . for this , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur . some programs do not save these data when you save the changed image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
the easiest way is to click on the thumb@@ nail with the right mouse button . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ me quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or finding a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; folding so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also re @-@ import your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select keyword lists from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can select a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the photo context menu and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , click the lower rec@@ tangle of the tim@@ eline , which displays the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
you can enter a title in the field below and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
mi@@ tig@@ ating the search box is a small lamp that will be green when finding hits . if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . after saving it , it will filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit the search , the search form will be displayed again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as an advanced search , the dialog for Advanced search will appear . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Clear in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed by operators separate , added . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or at least ... you can create searches of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a sw@@ ell@@ book .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em illuminated table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window , you can quickly open the light table with L Extras ligh@@ table .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy you want to see in which window pane .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using p@@ airing from the toolbar , the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the area . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on crossed arrows . to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then , in the preview , both pictures will display the same image area .
zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are previ@@ ewed in the Pre@@ view mode .
digital inventory management considers any part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use pictures again . we consider downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , secure , vali@@ date , archive , store , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Invent@@ ory administration takes up , index@@ ed , categ@@ or@@ ised , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content having a monetary or cultural value ; quot ; quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to save metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday images can be quickly found through your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant feed of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the metadata settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now choose any photo keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work .
let us now with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically insert the tree for you or insert images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very rough representation , since every block of metadata exists in truth out of many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance , there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this one of the allies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others looking at your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) as a cap@@ tion . if you export your images to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now already drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ocation are innum@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by pictures with geographic indications . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples can be titles like : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a remark to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this doesn &apos;t necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you can see the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this , in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you will find problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll On@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics on what reasons a data loss has .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you can no longer trust you for a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control environments . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8,5 GB .
slow down with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . afterwards , read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark @-@ dry and protected environment . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
your manufacturer &apos;s warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : dis@@ kette study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common cause of errors .
this is the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices do not make a lot of power , this can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause per@@ plex@@ ed key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it complies with the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to ensuring that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thereby protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a wear@@ able over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while a surge protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply .
in addition to protecting against surge , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow them to continue working until the current is running . if you purchase a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
you can get a high quality over@@ voltage protection up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , One 500@@ W U@@ PS you can pay for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are however very expensive compared to hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services which are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs , at least , ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that use Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of thi@@ eves is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : un@@ true , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : incorrect , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while the technology is developing , there is a natural border for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you have any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , changing disks or res@@ izing hard drives .
assume you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash fails you &apos;ll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ space : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ ast@@ ers always means a non @-@ local storage . bring up your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this approach leaves you enough time to detect and restore any losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associated X@@ MP files , retained original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look carefully and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to behave as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available to everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means to increase .
let &apos;s assume that you have included the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system but do not mount it .
&amp; dollars ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ GT ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of / dev / dev / s@@ d@@ c / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG can be used as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f , and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and has a slow compression .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open raw format format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format can be old . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from camera , card reader or scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes cut off by the other programs .
protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , code to MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed . in the section Ad@@ ding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to use , connect these to your computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the filen@@ ames and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that not all information is available for some digital cameras .
the Metad@@ ata tab shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the All Photos . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , just select the desired &amp; k@@ de default selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download@@ able is available . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you want to download the All Files or Select All Sel@@ ected , a dialog will appear with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tis ; loads the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , then you must select them first and then use Del@@ ete Sel@@ ected .
note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digi@@ ti@@ sed version ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this over the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording series into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es . if you are using this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three additional options which are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data to the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % % Y % H : % M : % S in the edit field . turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for further custom@@ ization you should read the command str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the camera file name option , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new filen@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is displayed beneath the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to time point recording to perform automatic turning during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually switched on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album when downloading . all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ d ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ graphi@@ ate an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . the question is therefore actually more how the data enters these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , through a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and finally about manual entry of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same as &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the default coordinates that are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. to access these settings , you need to select in the Edit menu . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select promotion can be set to preview or start image editing . in doing so , you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional description of the photographer . this can be names like e.g. hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not need to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this achieves that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
image resolution as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos using the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appear when the mouse cursor stays in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; album folder that has none of these extensions , from &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
the option &amp; quot ; In the entire image size , you can only use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better visual results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . that means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the TIFF file option , you can de@@ comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect image quality since the Def@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files can save you loss@@ less . even if you select the loss@@ less settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if using this option , the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the pointed @-@ lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned , because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed @-@ lights as a continuous white . the setting colors will produce some unusual results , since they can re@@ construct the highlights in various ros@@ ettes . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ws .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ tis ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when selecting the Rec@@ re@@ construc@@ ts option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zer ; to keep the time for the demo version small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding , since it is performed during raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture opens in image editing / color management module with raw files start .
color profile folder Sets the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then check this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are not managed the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are more options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image of a device would be returned . this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style of the destination recognis@@ able : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Set@@ ting Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes place the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera features show a list of all cameras supported at the left hand side . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the display mode . currently , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able to mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin you can indicate the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without queries . otherwise , you must save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the display of the welcome screen ; under certain circumstances , this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ tis ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , it asks &amp; digi@@ kam , whether it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to create , find more information about this in this tutorial .
the image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting the item View / Edit .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the image editing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file saving or the button Save from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this using File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using Rec@@ over or Rest@@ ore the button The Rest@@ ore image processing button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last storage .
virtually any image editing action can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Return or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl @-@ Z , and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; click the Return or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select En@@ large Automati@@ cally
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will see the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the toolbar will be displayed . if you do not want this , you can view this in the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases . you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the Album Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation files , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the margin .
in the label view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note that the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
once you have commented it , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the words used earlier in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; -@@ session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the input keyword . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if you have multiple images selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it to the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and afterwards a keyword is drawn from the right stit@@ ch tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings .
if you typically have created and created it , and find that it would have to be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the rules section .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an extended search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable vari@@ ance of the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme is applied to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , ink management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with more information about colour management . in addition , you should make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture issues are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and have to think about colour management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , then visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I need to c@@ alli@@ cker my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB is c@@ alli@@ br@@ ated on s@@ RGB . if you work as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you must either c@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ ous intensity values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point becomes as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
same : this method adjust@@ s the brightness range of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that produces either miracles in a picture or destroyed it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and bright fron@@ ts and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it from the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the thumb@@ nail preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your results depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or also dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it in a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find a color gra@@ ding in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ code ; tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar ion@@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect created by adding a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas were dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar ion@@ ization . at about 50 % intensity the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to generate on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot ; it differs from a satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . for large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ ality correction is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of sli@@ ders for the application described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel , or the selected area . below the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into that and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color twe@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . the compression of the output values can be used , for example , to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be stored and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , resources and sun@@ tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the hist@@ ogram &apos;s input values for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a short@@ wave to the right , for example the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright notes correspond with dark@@ er output tones and dark@@ er the corresponding pixels .
preview the original photos is a red marker . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is Gim@@ p &apos;s curve format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you will get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shade and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are on the right side : kno@@ bs for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you activate the corresponding color components . this is especially handy if you also have the option Mon@@ och@@ rome , as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . the color space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same position in the color channel and their noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender settings for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on seeing the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is stored . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image is shown below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating due to your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green len@@ tic@@ filter . this looks good , with all scenes and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
Gel@@ b@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ thel@@ ia : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading stems . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ ti@@ zed ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect was applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed in ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ ti@@ zer ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture . permanently , the image transforms with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ hole and decorative add an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with your mouse . use text style , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tools template apply you can put a template on a picture .
the menu Tem@@ plate App@@ ly in Image Processing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil / digi@@ ti@@ zed database , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the knob basic folder . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears which mirrors the folder structure of the box folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the preview bar of the templates .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
res@@ ize : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to make the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template onto your picture . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it produces gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ red M@@ ask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psych@@ edel@@ u@@ ell . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focused is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this in turn causes sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when colors are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG pictures a camera is often used internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers have a field of sharp@@ ness already during reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your picture .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Field menu item to view this .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tness with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ ates will create near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ i . therefore , you should therefore best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount is equal to the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , one can define a minimal difference thus for an edge of the filter applied . thus , areas with a soft switch between the tones are exemp@@ t from sharpen@@ ing and therefore avoid beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the picture . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focused mostly achieves better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular fis@@ sion works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s fold . the G@@ auss &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality becomes very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is &apos; sch &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ze &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load K@@ buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cut@@ ters , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible , but which later left unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king of a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the slider smooth@@ es the blur@@ ring of the area which has been dark@@ ened so as to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ spec@@ tus was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smo@@ othing over the image . whereas larger values mainly smo@@ othing and sharp detail . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
level@@ ing dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only smooth@@ es in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD images a high value will generate a high value . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed with a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is much noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles create a long run time . therefore , you should make this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is only small , but it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend it to exit it .
the Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts are corrected . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact that is caused by a poor film storage during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ red the image . the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is increased , you may need to adjust the edges -@@ filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubric@@ ate occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks may occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend that you change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically smo@@ ked more strongly .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines as quickly the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high a blur@@ ring may occur . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at the edges . it can remove rough tips and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used precisely for this purpose . all parameters for the reduction of the noise you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tness with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Upload buttons make this exactly . every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera to a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel photos that were used with a CCD camera close to eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark image . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the picture to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard knows the last dark and will automatically load it back in the next session .
the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all pre@@ views .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area uni@@ form@@ ly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot@@ ot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the ir@@ is filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color and gray scale of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the mold vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damp@@ ing at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , reduce it to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you only have positive values at your disposal , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine read@@ just@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed version is a tool for correc@@ ting the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the second gra@@ der co@@ effici@@ ents the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ rical distortion can almost be eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second gra@@ des . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade . this value works more strongly on margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter &apos; has the reverse signature of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image dimin@@ ishes .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjust@@ s brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all tri@@ mming or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be obvious to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to view the dotted lines . move it to an important place like the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point .
if you correct a ver@@ tex @-@ shaped distortion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Rem@@ ove cro@@ pping from the image editing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR @-@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for previ@@ ewing . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option F@@ ew Movie Arran@@ gement if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
the digi@@ code ; filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies , producers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO Sensi@@ tivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film body effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; oil painting filter creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ code ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and style @-@ life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brush is better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the digi@@ code ; filter coal drawing utili@@ zes color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon escal@@ ator . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch for you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon labelling filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works very well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ astic landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Tou@@ gh@@ ness : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixel around one point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of un@@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
sof@@ tening : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . as the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the image .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing one area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the range will remain free from ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ers Rot@@ ating or Transform@@ ers mirr@@ oring .
blowing photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here does a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the Transformation size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
maintaining aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any recording for photo enlar@@ ges can be saved as text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement compared .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put a picture together . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ tangle . you will see this rec@@ tangle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . a new rec@@ tangle will create by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cut @-@ out button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio cutting uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . ratio knob to set the range to the greatest possible depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ der aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the sett@@ ling help settings allow help to fade , so that you can better assemble your images . these aids are :
harmonious tri@@ angles : harmonic sections are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third angel , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tangle into a similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden center : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who constructed their temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the descending divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid guides when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will help you achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye focuses on the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle @-@ points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no con@@ current tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can be released a static object dynamic .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is ter@@ med by professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the tilt angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you move it over an important point of the image , you can fix it by pressing the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the Auto Cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after turning . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right @-@ hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
new Hei@@ ght : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels .
angle on top left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle on the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right side : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is a bit lubric@@ ated . for a single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you will get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming crop cutting out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformer sciss@@ ors .
use your image by drag@@ ging the horizontal and vertical angle . you can shift horizontally and vertically at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview pane .
move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two she@@ aths satisfy twice as much knowledge and therefore you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ar , the picture has tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming crop cutting out of the image processing .
digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
this is done based on file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the file extension is edited ; you can change this list of file extensions . see the configuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG under the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful gu@@ id@@ ances in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use digi@@ ti@@ zed modules .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports loading of rough images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web site of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in capabilities to display or edit movies . when you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ icle . you can only go forward if you have gone back before .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description follows here .
all editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focused , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc . . use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontally divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ ouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to choose the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed that your pictures contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ ettes files installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the Select Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check@@ box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated by the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different one ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ writing selected , you can set this mode by selecting the box over@@ write under the mouse cursor .
a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the copying , cut and paste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color , three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color sel@@ ections can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ ph viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graphs and displays them in &amp; k@@ ph ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ph ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting at about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ ph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; D@@ ot ; for the representation of the graph . needs are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ ph viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ ph viewer ; set up ... also see also .
if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ ph viewer ; -@@ Inst@@ ance , eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you will have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ph viewer ; -@@ Inst@@ ance or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also be changed using the Setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be con@@ stru@@ ed to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask the program every time .
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time a graph is requested .
the session management site provides the option to set the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the last session files ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithm . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graph . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ executed graphs . it produces images according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a spring @-@ spring model layout for un@@ created graphs . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .

read the K@@ IP@@ I module pictures provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears , which lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default values for your own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and customize the area to suit your needs before using the button Scan to view the image . you will find the estimated file size in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the button scan , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
when all of your program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above .

the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are led through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is virtually your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you click Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current permissions that the module displays . for up@@ loading , you need write permissions . the module now also does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the Add Photos button should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the C@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS lane as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic localization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and run the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alisation , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were taken at the same places as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ dates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a locomotive is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same location . since the dialog shows the coordinates of one call to the next you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the map shown below . select the region in question and enlarge it . then , select this region and increase it again and again until you have reached a satisfactory level of accuracy . the map can always be selected manually between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages con@@ forming to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not shown hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right side , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also saved in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . it naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails that are small images that are shown in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module generated pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can select the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are listed under Image Files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to return the file to a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as close as possible .
if you specify an audio file named the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start the generation of the movie with the button encoding . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the Settings button on the bottom right corner .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ sc@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use them further , you should not choose the JPEG format , since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the star number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using the button images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and drop them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
remove images from the list of images to send .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not be closed automatically to view the status messages when searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . you can close this window with the Connect button .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow there will be a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can select here between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant picture transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly choose that the images are displayed in a random order . so , it is not the order of the images used in the album .
between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly select another effect between the images .
during slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move your mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Back@@ ground image is a tool for setting a picture as wallpaper for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can start with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , now there are entries in each group , so in people , places and group keywords entries .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see image .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area of influence .
in the picture each person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which is of course also valid for places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture .
to view images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not own suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to choose which image for each individual person to be displayed . to do this , you need to select the image @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the categories editor in the context menu . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you access the search entry in the main window , a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the label or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user &apos;s manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialogue , if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry in the menu Help menu . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this period will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is included in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas contents , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; photo@@ album ; export file will be created to be seen on the overview page .
last but not least , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages , so you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all images are of a party . note that all images are exported from a party . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not dealt with specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can scan your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
the best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages were created . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to it . thus , the Import function , see , right works , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described are related to all three root folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in this folder , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time for it the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to start with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this work does not even do .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have provided when creating HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can view from the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the Manual to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file to the .@@ k@@ im file , the images will automatically be copied for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . as most pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option on this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import ... , it will import &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the import wizard consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder you want to import images to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category individuals of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is written to your database people . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen in the picture .
it just has to be to browse and view pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; for example , if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this manual you will go through the different steps from ( 1 ) set up the information about your images , about ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today your videos are taking care of . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; Photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. , normal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; Photo@@ album ; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically use it in future starts . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
set up menu entry Settings ... Get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help that you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option .
it was described how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories are already mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , set up all members of a group at once instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; its modular system shares with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be inv@@ oked through the module menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; only very little have been tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you use them on your own ima@@ ger &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo database can be accessed either through the command line using the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications incorporate their images into albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; this sort of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order of albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
thereby simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures showing you the picture preview currently .
in addition to the current album , I have to give the modules a list of albums , as follows :
if &amp; sz@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . for example , if you are using the category people , you will have to do so , so whether you would have selected people to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the Setup dialog and select in the module modules which modules you want to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . currently , it does not contain too much information , since you have not yet entered information about your images . in the section we will come back to this window , but now click on the entry Add images to show you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the picture was taken . for example , you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . for example , on all images of Jes@@ per , and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can find that the names used are moved up , the people find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting symbol by date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail on the top right .
if you recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the comment dialog &apos;s context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Excel or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it to a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the pane area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings , click on the Options button ... which allows you to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have not set a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Clear in the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; namely images also without saving you on your hard drive . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so you can preview these images . however , you can not view these images with the image viewer .
as you see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid mixing your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click on Current View in the privacy menu .
this way you have set out which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , so all the pictures you have blocked will be hidden . if you want to retrieve the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; over a picture _ and video viewer . these can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether you want to display information at all . all these options are available right @-@ click on the viewer . the appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images uploaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
when multiple images are uploaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can pull out a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . use the Min@@ us key to zoom out again . the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation key , the zoom is placed , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work on videos play in and out with the plus and minus key .
you can rotate the image using the script functions from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the picture . at the moment you can view the snapshot and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while viewing them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in this you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are placed .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so if you have all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply complete all of them at once with notes . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in the preview screen , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in Can you see a picture on the painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; turn on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to App@@ ly these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly , or disc@@ ard changes with Cancel .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; input user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ arranged item . if you only want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the shar@@ er to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the path to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the shar@@ er in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the sp@@ lash to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the connector bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can be saved with View Window Order ... Save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon at the toolbar , or select the Ren@@ dering menu item View .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can add as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... from the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image editing for rendering in the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray each pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as default an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling includes the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is split again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are separately pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on j@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection comp@@ utes . it takes very long to let a scene comp@@ ute with this property .
on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated radiation does not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray / Sc@@ ene , select File Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; not yet the complete set of commands of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur while im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; ren@@ ders a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . here you will find the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and spins .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for advanced projections , all the wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach to the projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the floor is displayed in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di , you can specify the values for depth and threshold .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window configurations will explain how to create and store window arrangements .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Panel Standard Window Order : displays all existing window configurations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the existing window arrangement shows all existing window configurations . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all the views for the selected window order . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Rem@@ ove button .
with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you will anchor the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; inst@@ alls and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a ball at a level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you will receive a black image .
if you don &apos;t want to add light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have everything correctly installed , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following pres@@ et window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get an idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . thus you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the App@@ den button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately in accordance with these settings . as a result , you can see the scene from the perspective of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a Qu@@ ader ( In@@ sert Last Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , albeit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fl@@ atten the item for the bottom when you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , turning and shifting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = base pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment will only show a matte black material , because you can still check the pigment settings . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . also , there are many possibilities , but now take the simplest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then invoke the preview .
the material for the bottom is now set correctly . if you render your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are more settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the enter key or the button ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you have shifted the bottom to one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First Sub@@ jects and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some Finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the Enter key .
the settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog occur .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be added to this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage have been rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ t command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; , here you can change the look , key short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to change pre@@ defined short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ am@@ end rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Di@@ alogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ de Show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the key short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this item is checked , loading &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you can still view the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for slideshow .
with this option you save &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when you finish the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; C@@ ick@@ show opens ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in window mode , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can create &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types will display , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specifies whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show here ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
this option allows you to switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; project .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all the information you need is filled in , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ foto , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you can answer here questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list by &amp; show@@ foto ; .
&amp; show@@ foto ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you have to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ foto ; to access these settings , you have to select in the menu Settings show@@ foto ; set up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image editing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel and Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the button settings will open the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Fig@@ ures save . dialog to store for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will be automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without searching for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved when saving without a filen@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... Change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saving images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric su@@ ff@@ ix each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button About starts the K@@ DE over -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global key short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and set up Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... by right @-@ clicking in the player window and set short@@ cuts ... Select .
you can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts work . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to tell the user why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this is usually done using the ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is picked up . the script could now and z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information about the new piece ( for example , metadata or unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected playlist files , if a custom menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove one entry .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ending , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the suff@@ ocation of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages right correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it at www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and follow the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you shouldn &apos;t have any trouble when you compile it . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
store voice files in music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok to start when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
when saving play@@ lists while moving , the current playlist automatically saves when ending &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date pieces when changing the piece of play , that the play@@ lists window will pop up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window pane .
changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok , set . by marking the own fonts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped during the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
use your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the sc@@ allo@@ yed as well as their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the portion of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further equipment is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , under Port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card card last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; do some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and then app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will lead to crashes while editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable the machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send the back@@ trace to us by email ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . please note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting will show its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to make Amar@@ ok the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . for this , use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in Channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one error if you find something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intui@@ tively hold the interface , the startup window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column evaluation . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove From the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let it drop there just as you would like to do with other files .
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ ary , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is : which media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well , ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run the follow @-@ up registers to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask in the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( stop Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download the ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with dest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to bed .
how can you get the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok , if you are on a different computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ p d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your User@@ name with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button places a piece in the click sequence into the queue . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
the internal SQL database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD from the menu . for the normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this fits the previous evaluation with a declining value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual assessment has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for one piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece exactly as all other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button on the piece and pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a defined publication plan that cannot be combined with the short @-@ term scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option symbol while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Control Palette Pre@@ ferences ... and make the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click to install new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
audio @-@ rob@@ bers is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you must re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled using P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up Am@@ ok ... Audio Output will give you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 } c@@ t@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio issue with Arts won &apos;t be cared for . you may of course take this issue yourself into your hand ! if you like , you can become the new as much @-@ needed main@@ tain@@ er for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are content with the playlist , the tree view will immediately save only the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the playlist to save them . you will find this button in the toolbar of the play@@ lists window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ lists browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to im@@ porting play@@ lists , these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will get different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please play the Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu . here you have several options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages will be listed which make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player , it also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok can be used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play or current stream . just below is the range , the playing time , bit rate , and sampling rate of the current piece . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change by the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons on the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up an equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control , and play @-@ position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser shows different information regarding the current piece . its look can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ting . these three sub@@ windows are explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may have noticed that the under@@ panel starts off . the information shown there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( optional statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running track , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to review the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourites of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is still running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is needed .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com following the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - grouped only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces will be sorted according to interpreter and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted by genre first by genre and among them by interpre@@ ts .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
directly under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , from the last 24 hours to a year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set the pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked by a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the Media Player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Metad@@ ata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files into the garbage dump ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and then it appears among different performers .
pick up the compilation selection - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be shown under different performers but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelligent play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window will be used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpre@@ ting sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive engagement for your iPod .
under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can pick music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is last longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping it . in this case , holding down the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically add dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop . once you enter characters , only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separated search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you type for example one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type OR type between search words , search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example , rating : &gt; 50 . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular keyword , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order to the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left @-@ hand side , you will find the Add button to which you can add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons follow rever@@ ber@@ ations and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button on the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you can see in the player window by the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by double clicking twice in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry opens the Visu@@ alization Plugins window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you will have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays are played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( details for setting up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces already exist in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist .
double click the playlist you want , drag it to the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on it and then select Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pres@@ et Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the Play@@ list Emp@@ f@@ ohl@@ ene pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . this will also disable the dynamic mode again using the same menu entry .
the New Play@@ list button empty the current playlist and add new ch@@ unks to the dynamic mode . editing the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be passed and they will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while respecting the settings .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see what pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ able play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts install by clicking on script . it will open a selection dialog where you can select a script package to install . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you do not want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts .
the Visu@@ alization Plugin is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , just activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when encoding bit@@ rates , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format . use the project au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the computer finishes the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings to burn .
after you have made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this :
in this dialog you can follow the progress of the copy process . once read the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write fla@@ c files .
li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . for example , with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t w@@ ma files and then burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ V@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to customize the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces will play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new filen@@ ame .
save the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown to select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would run for each individual project file saving .
if a project has changed and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then switch between saving and changes . additionally , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project is asked what to do , as if you had called file sc@@ rap@@ ing .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this feature only appears with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only da@@ zzles the previously imported files .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a DVD copy to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . copying / crus@@ hing a DVD with the help of the copy dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the total ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the Table of Content allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the level view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs when a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view has open projects . the header strip has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment further down .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . to do this , you need system administrator rights , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; general program settings can be made here . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of your task is crucial , which will give you preference .
in this chapter we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and further functions for generating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Photo@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void @-@ format@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void g@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String parent ) void re@@ ame@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ t@@ xt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ readers for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data into wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ded these wa@@ v files ( These Ko@@ di@@ ers Pack@@ ages must be installed from the Linux distribution ) . more Ko@@ di@@ fiers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ vers must be installed . all these programs are generally available for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything themselves .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the Wel@@ sh Ko@@ di@@ ver chapter gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from CD &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handle protection , it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD ; even not the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid simply buying a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use to read a &amp; CD ; to the hard drive explains . this ( hopefully ) leads to understanding the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble in at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can get &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or work completely without a network , everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example , there are more information on how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
start the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be established first . )
start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup alog - coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it should be noted that previously the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main alignment dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the encoder ) . go here before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , differences become less important , since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ ks . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ San@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated to most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t must be added to l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , download / enter the information , so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine . it is worth not@@ ing that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is active to dial a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; set up for use by fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest reflection server is needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save to wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used for this ; if you want to know more exactly , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
for saving the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ g@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . further information on Ko@@ di@@ fiers can be found in the Wel@@ sh Ko@@ di@@ ver chapter .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device identi@@ fier of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read values on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et Extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 up to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read it the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device identi@@ fier of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing records of device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map map General Settings . there &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as in@@ laid / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in the case of incomplete information , you will be informed , so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during read @-@ out of the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filen@@ ames or tag records , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ qu@@ iter &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; node ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , it is over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as concerns the server , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ g the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously out@@ going pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? read and code ? the author does not know , therefore simply try .
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
just enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core , or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can attempt to encoding more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any read@@ out of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you will never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; which is running on the hard drive . we will create and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any read &amp; CD ;
since we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data you have fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not the &amp; CD ; this example to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive which has been defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , consult the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully retri@@ eved from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comment@@ aries per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see Help for the encoder to get more information .
just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read @-@ out CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked in this way are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or click the Select All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if the selection process is started by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a coefficient you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . in case of performance @-@ weak machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at the same time reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is part of the modem @-@ driven package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k ; -@@ package . if you read this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at persons who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running , then the following is true for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many options . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still to read ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any reference point as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if at the time of program start no audio CD ; in the drive is ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ generator ; may it do . at least after making contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has a real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( such as song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session Support . if you end &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button on the toolbar , select the play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played together . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the slider .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows left and right of the template and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the play menu , interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the spac@@ eb@@ ar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two styles in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved for a song , so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the automatic text selection , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these will be played back in the series . in this section , you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the counter@@ f@@ eit in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you exit the application , this collection is not stored . remember when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select collections from the sub@@ menu of the menu list , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next song , next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right .
to reverse a song , select the previous piece button , the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map compil@@ es General MIDI events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implem@@ ent@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI &apos;s patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the note with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following into the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with a patch 127 ( shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term drum patch refers to a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc . ) , and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( like some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument . you just have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are mainly used to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . for example , take a look at the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
mi@@ di devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies where pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ occur@@ ren@@ ces are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pian@@ os ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button will no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the Settings menu under the View Channel view : settings
the tempo LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed , etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
before you activate the setting automatically add the automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn on the automatic add to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ F. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so set the setup automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ C and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much free time for my hob@@ bies but I &apos;m trying to take some time . as a hob@@ bies I have programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension by &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a huge joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will record with friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I may already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and got money from anybody . I would like to point out that I only keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ eker , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ d@@ son , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , it can be found on its homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and view pictures . you will also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of our mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ d ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ lists .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to receive an additional hierarchy of hierarch@@ ies . when you select an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry .
the categories &apos; updates &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; you can also change the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ cken , then select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select play@@ lists from the same menu and select either the editing mode or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is abandoned or another group is selected without having to match the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files ..
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ver@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; and lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; / Body ; / lt ; / Body ; / Body ; / Body ; / Body ; / Body ; / Body ; / S@@ smil@@ ed ; In the tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special embed tag for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can be played in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mim@@ e @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog File Reg@@ ulations of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is used in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always use a given back@@ end for a certain Mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , it must be done by changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device must be used and the TV channels need to be used . this can be used by the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected by which one is selected . the encoding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it .
because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player only can use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be working . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , various names are used by S@@ MEs for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after plug@@ ging the device . it is absolutely sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ priced . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; box ;
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) is used .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ;
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the box should be made .
if you have questions about or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed on the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities should be consul@@ ted the manual on K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros can also use . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here just a good overview of &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to master &amp; latex ; good books should be used for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
as well as other labelling schemes include &amp; latex ; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , project projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom defined .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be selected ( for correct processing of the latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex ; for integration they need to be selected only in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . only a short description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source code editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see gr@@ ated areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you may notice it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and poin@@ ter by high@@ lighting .
with automatic execution of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the added line to pass the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the box settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the placing of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when a DVI ; file is created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer becomes the appropriate line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; There are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the tag search , the elements of the DVI ; file were used with the editor and as soon as an element was cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is applied . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section is spec@@ kl@@ ed in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be configured through project project settings .
quick installation : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is at the end of the n@@ der@@ s@@ â and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation .
when viewing the Edit tool@@ bars , the three large selection boxes should be visible . the selection boxes have been developed for the quick installation of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as Tags , notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( sel@@ ects a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually written .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ .@@ e is used for specifying the font size . you can specify the font size for the main text , the mer@@ ges , etc . there are the following font sizes available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ document@@ ar@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code needs to be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the volume construction or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using rapid construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another type of let@@ tering . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the change of the font sizes inside the environment .
the changes are sur@@ vey@@ ed only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } up to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , passive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics pressure and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be represented itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background to write the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . for this , min@@ d. a quotation , a few passages in bold and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor view or C@@ trl @-@ E can be converted back to the editor ( the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( engl . D e V ICE I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . in the seventh step , after clicking on a DVI , the document can then be printed using file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; -@@ Source text , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search string allows the direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . for this only Modern under Settings box has to be set up ... tools Building .
in order to select the preferred search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on to search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document by &amp; Ki@@ le ; required and bound to the appropriate line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; defined as text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ eces ... Editor )
if the user does not open the &amp; DVI ; viewer does not open , there may be errors . if an error occurs , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file contains the source code error source . in the editor you can use the sp@@ ects &apos; laun@@ cher La@@ Te@@ X errors and NU@@ LL La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . to view the incorrect line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the incorrect line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document .
multi@@ level user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template using the opening of an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings box ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering in document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ entary &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document is created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files are created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; box ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about it ; and to know its possibilities , the manual can be consul@@ ted from K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; they can be used as well as their syntax .
double click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when drag@@ ging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumps within the text . this is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . the menu edit jumps or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is also highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering excellent possibilities , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ Source texts ; special commands for their selection .
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only preventive thing in &amp; Ki@@ le is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this option also has an extended meaning as this command also adds &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete part of the document , of course this can be selected first and be removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a quicker possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to Edit Sel@@ ection paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to stream the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
when the cursor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by clas@@ ps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
with this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the sh@@ red@@ ded clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ led clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups brackets , the overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a seal . for the purpose @-@ carrying implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the character &apos; is used for two simple reference marks . also for ending the request the character &apos; is &apos; used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; &apos; knows this case and makes two closing notes for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic insert of double quotation marks can be set up under Set@@ ting box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
there can also be ad @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and there@@ with German or French suits are used . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; enter key &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ closed with a close line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to enable this . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the adjacent row . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator does not belong to the table , add to the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offering a good source code execution , it has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for natural latex ; ) , different modes are installed . three of these work as needed and the other two are for automatic execution . all of these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings box ... fully set up .
at the beginning a new environment is executed using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , by default , the list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . however , the descriptions are also removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump handles may be added , so that a simple jump to these positions via edit jumps is possible and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; ful@@ fills can be made settings to these lists . there can be different types of j@@ ars for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as books of general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of the default mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the execution of environments .
when calling the default mode over the edi@@ fying environment or key / key Alt + Shift key space , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the Enter key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; ful@@ fills can be made settings to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ aves List of the full @-@ up mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of dependen@@ cies that are immediately replaced by lower strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... boxes can be set up . as an example of a cooling list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated by the Edit menu , or the C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the character L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large W@@ aves are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once . this provides &amp; Ki@@ le ; the full support for all the already written documents .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled . here , also the threshold for the display of the completion can be specified .
the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the dialogue graphics make the creation of graphics as easy as possible . to review the basics to the graphic formats , the sections and attention should be considered .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the result of work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation of comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key , Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Start command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be asked about the New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not been developed yet and can be changed in further versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first you have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite out system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; -@@ reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is to search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on and done the symbol for the XML processor !
this application expects a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the weigh@@ ed work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the just opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book then just leave it to the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then they let the current file simply be checked . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - File Sel@@ ection .
if you only want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the Well @-@ formed Check Sel@@ ection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; using definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already marked then they can be simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file .
specify the name of the file as the result should have been named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , laugh@@ ed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . more about this can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all plug@@ ins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often several people work in a hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something is happening . see for more information .
event actions are actions performed when something specific occurs in the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project , so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that includes a file into CVS , once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the site configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the receiver list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following :
enter comments is simple . you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the inserted nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team Leader Sub@@ project Manager .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
tags : large / L@@ ump@@ y of automatically inserted tags . normal Gross / lower case means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in tag@@ XML files .
case @-@ sensitive attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Gross / lower case means that the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags , except for simple tags .
automatically update start and finish day : if switched on , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic set @-@ up of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for detection of different types of files . res@@ etting the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash , the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ point ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview , and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to default at the next start is useful if the user interface is mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the section of Struc@@ tural Tree Settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deeply in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such as no element found in the current document .
the area for specifying abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are un@@ folded in editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ ty abbrevi@@ ation signi@@ fies something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any kind @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then select if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , since version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging has been completely newly developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view in which all mounting points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or a part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it shares the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ ck session Start the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output pane .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if the script is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution runs further . if it happens before a debit note is given , execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include is corrected .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many more works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . toolbar , the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user may ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the day . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without any risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag . ( family 1 only )
set a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a just element type element .
specifies an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ ame % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined . this element is a just element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an XML declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check occurs only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file is to be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; routine name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User &apos;s button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but then it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is trying to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be attached to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be submitted by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field entry can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages are directed to standard output . it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure promotions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable dialog &quot; Edit Day &quot; when available so that entering the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that the action represents better we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be shared by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar and set the tool@@ bars selected . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bars might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save to the proper folder . after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust its &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its tool bar ( s ) is loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus - Rep@@ osit@@ ory whether someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub @-@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known boundary for the shaft depth ( except for reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently on the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but look for &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
the contents section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the Cont@@ ext@@ List and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are certain that these are well and worth being shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the wa@@ sted resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else to whom . in different places there is an email @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , toolbar menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . to make an online contribution , we recommend using a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when you upload your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase , you will be asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New Resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar toolbar , and start from the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it cau@@ tions and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the creator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML language that is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can start from menu DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine tuning of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to gain full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
global elements are stored for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bl@@ ends the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ points , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area to another context menu with respect to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / copy / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse poin@@ ter , using the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , when the string is ter@@ med a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree view .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of re@@ integration in Global , Local and Project works here as well . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element there is a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree @-@ views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system oriented to the content enables the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here &apos;s the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be app@@ ended , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two cart@@ ons at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bars as compressed ts@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ! so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developing what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is provided with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changing every time you open a file that is not located on it , and the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts from clip@@ board there special characters to &amp; HTML ; spell checking so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection respectively . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very useful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are saved with file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there , allowing you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , managed the project . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bars . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this just creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... added . tool bars are stored by toolbar toolbar , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removing a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the tool@@ bars , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team to allow the toolbar to be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting the paste by toolbar if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug@@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items above . click on it . click an activated plug @-@ in to disable it .
select syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS , or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different kinds of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or not create nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window respectively .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which you can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be filled from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all those paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties can be set .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is empty , the default settings for the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be activated when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be modified in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window or modified using Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries will be explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed can be selected . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files window , upload profiles can be set ( see in ) as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking on its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project will open from the toolbar . the Project dialog will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button :
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten during programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the record store option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be uploaded to different servers for the project ( or parts of the project ) . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this doesn &apos;t have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use them according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply drag@@ ging the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via the toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which you can do the most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , preferably st@@ ack@@ able from the Tools menu . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the section Ad@@ ding toolbar .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) in which new action , a new toolbar can be created , and other actions such as toolbar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where it can be indicated which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings ... and specify the actions settings ..
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you set up for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents with links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents will be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be added to the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As a template Save As local template ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click Save as template Save as Local / Project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically connect to &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or associate with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Tem@@ plate sub@@ window is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Share@@ and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows leading or re @-@ featured text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying contents templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( shown to press right mouse button ) over a full command library for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu . first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one shares the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure activ@@ ates the active cursor from one window to the other , with the position being retained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL ; -@@ View one can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small span for fast machines and a large span for slow ones .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the title of the website , so it is possible to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; this will help reduce the manual encoding .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by clicking on the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the return button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars , such as the sp@@ read@@ sheet assistant or the lists wizard , are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; the tables or lists must be used in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a filen@@ ame without a path name . file names in the same folder as the top loaded still file name with relative path to working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a for@@ age named QNAP or a specified model name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP string containing the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought after point has to be terminated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be performed automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can browse the commands executed so far with the arrow keys on / off by the path memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument is a holding point in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; set .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; cri@@ mp@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where the ind@@ entation could have changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the reference windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a fully fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 way merging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; -@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps in comparing and merging the complete folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ spl@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; K diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and follow the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain amount of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are located in different folders , you can make typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
2 @-@ sided folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 @-@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der 2 @-@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o Dest@@ ination Fol@@ der
the Open dialog allows you to manually type file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will notice your selection and show it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders will be initiated . however , if A file is selected , for B and C , a folder is then used , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if merging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving .
the Set@@ ting button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison will start immediately . in the open dialog you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and compare the relevant sections .
note : at present , you can &apos;t get out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while .
the three spring windows are the letters A , B and C . a has the color Blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color which is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( merging ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare single cases . )
the vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is checked , the line will be shown on the dotted lines .
the result window ( below the comparative windows ) also has an info line with the inscription edition : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; hits &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons spr@@ int to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , every difference must also be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be shown in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this also causes a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . )
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing ; there is only one plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marking that you may perhaps copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . proceed with this function carefully .
note : if the sources are ignored or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , side down , side down , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are also used by other programs . the over@@ sight column next to the vertical scroll bar can be used by clicking on also for navig@@ ating .
in the For@@ k window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option Sel@@ ection automatically copy . if this is enabled , whatever you select is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and copying the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore it to the next start . ( setup menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences will be displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ er@@ ily . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically creates an odd color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press Enter or Return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line is automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual into the clip@@ board then drops .
you can choose which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white signs are ignored . also when merging , white signs are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only a new@@ line character , though they are different . if this option is checked , these options may be displayed with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but when merging , this option must be disabled . this option is disabled during default .
in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search inten@@ sely after even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before proceeding to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if the white signs in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merging menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge . see documentation for the folder comparison and merge documentation for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to exit &amp; ch@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding will be a brief indication of what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress signs of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; lt ; &amp; quot ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ C is displayed next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply exit the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the line of the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program this by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line letters to convert the input in upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that matches the found text in the first clamp . \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generating $ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line interc@@ ept . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Each sign between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit will be replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and merging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ balancing algorithm considers .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merging and shows the simulated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging individual files . you just need to specify the folders on the command line or in the dialog .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed by a small message window about current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then are listed .
when the scanning of the folders is finished , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by double @-@ clicking the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging can not be started .
the synchron@@ izing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option to synchron@@ ize directories is active . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible filen@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after merging copies &amp; co@@ effici@@ ents ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging ( in@@ secure ) is selected , then examines &amp; D diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and performs the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .
while merging , one file is processed after another . it displays status column when merging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if merging is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ folder merge mode , B will be used as the target , the two folder merge is chosen as the target , and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B will be used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only select the current item , select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merge actions , a message appears to indicate the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries a dialog box appears with the options , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel .
select Shi@@ ite if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; K diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merging window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again / continue directory merge / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved , an appropriate dialog will pop up . then &amp; k diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; put on an error , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . if you continue merging ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries will not be merged once more . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not stored , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merging action , these entries will be merged once more .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
for links to folders : if the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively . ( note that if the option contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the date of modification . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the results are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because the knowledge is provided that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and ob@@ liter@@ ated .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to normal merging of individual files , not only the merging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view remains visible in the merging of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the directory &amp; text window into main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window .
you can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . by saving the result , the status will be set to Er@@ le@@ wron@@ ged and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative und@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of the limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change date differ from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3 part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file has a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; K diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; cas@@ diff@@ 3 ; performed as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . merging or comparing folder is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the diff utility collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or that they will go .
you compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the configure script to the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. , u@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is this one is often the case .
the editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c has been defeated ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; K diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; -@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .

cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . inser@@ ting ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the A , B and C labelling below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
this option is disabled in default . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work@@ spaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and end . if , however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minim@@ ise , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work areas .
when this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops is displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this box lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are marked with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
if this field is checked , the current programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; only empty areas are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main windows can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N ra@@ ster , as from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers appear ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical bar in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the work surface .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be altered in size , view and move windows as symbols or with their contents .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can zoom a part of the screen , as if you read the newspaper a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down window ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid pointing the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in drop @-@ down mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , press the button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the Update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , new @-@ loading ( with the button document re @-@ loading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a magni@@ fier to view the clip in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual impair@@ ment .

&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; has been developed by Olaf Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ midt @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and any mouse click prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while at the same location . it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and each mouse click em@@ ulate pain . however , it may em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice however .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer . if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to clarify again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement .
the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wa@@ its it to the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can drag the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if Intelligent Move is enabled , the shooting area is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before it leaves the mouse button again when no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function activ@@ ates , creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ current kes@@ .t@@ xt , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can drag &amp; kiss to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider @-@ bar buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there .
reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you already hit the user button , the settings will be reset to the level after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be disabled first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease in sounds .
first , you should be aware of what places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . thus , accidental moving can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent moving is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board and execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : at the one end of the text area , select a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is played every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when intelligent shifting . later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension has to be installed for &amp; X windows ; this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker , and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain in the mouth .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to have a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . thus , the drag and drop can also be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which dum@@ b users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course phrases that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the Assistant ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the Setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text file directory . from the text passages , you can often choose used text passages without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the words tran@@ scription . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the language chosen to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can match the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white box in the screen@@ shot ) and a flow storage of the already spoken sets ( the upper white box in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have set up k@@ mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is app@@ ended to the main memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; Set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two map cards , voice output and settings , the site wor@@ d@@ get@@ ing and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the language output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be given as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standardized interface for voice output is provided and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage menu or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Im@@ medi@@ ate the selected text passage is spoken directly and in addition to the memory memory inserted . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered only into the input field .
with the second drop down of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text fit directory should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ way is not saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text fit directory is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the translation . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box you can choose the currently used dictionary for wor@@ d@@ work .
using the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is easily determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; once inserted words automatically add to the dictionary , you generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books can be accessed either through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the default memory .
the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected phrases of the default memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be moved by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . the bar is located by default on the editing window directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card language output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use festival free of charge and to distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax likes to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; net@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be switched on as standard input .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide speech service that provides a standard interface for voice output to all &amp; cans ; K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sets is stored which the user can re@@ distribute again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer is included . a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .

speech output is performed by the program speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language expendi@@ tures on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading texts from a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ blank mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org .
before you can use it , you have to install speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the board map is displayed .
most T@@ TS @-@ Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variations for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the speed @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher should otherwise use the standard speaker .
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
if you click on the map @-@ leading speaker in Oc@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board will be displayed . this will automatically appear when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all already furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application does not provide a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to push the speaker down a row further down . the order of speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the card board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can almost use it . go back to the Card General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled , so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map card orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice @-@ sharing system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the map link General to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the box card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS system of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs &amp; ts ; further , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and Oc@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar while reading , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this series you can start , ab@@ ort , pause and record text jobs .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the map and enable voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text which is to be read and select text from the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read displayed text . check first if &amp; t@@ ts ; then check the text which is to be read and select text from the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this works even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you about events you see . you can also read &amp; dict@@ ate the text of these messages .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , set up a message in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry appears in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ No@@ tify differ depending on the application .
a good example is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the program speech dis@@ pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . when the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved jobs are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after issuing the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; No@@ ti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be even more types of filters .
string translators replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre @-@ defined string insertion filters such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable format .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ S@@ LT files for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speakers selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . si@@ e@@ e. read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text application , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ d ; -@@ notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by the filters is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are processed in the range down@@ wards from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for setting strings , you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . upper and lower case is not considered when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Re@@ place . the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the spokes@@ man for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID is copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you can only type copies .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string enforcement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited to both sides by separ@@ ations .
in this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can use it in the dialog or Edit as help to assemble these expressions .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
with the language selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card board or@@ ator , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; t@@ ts ; there is a text to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program pres@@ ets that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected , and the characteristics of the speakers furnished on the card board . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which best meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialog for Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the ec@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you can give
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . just start t@@ ts@@ d in a window , then Oc@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the above language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ DATA@@ form@@ er@@ Filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must do that even if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found through the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation signs seem to cause errors at the synthes@@ izer so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ cat@@ cher is spent . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , these may be remedi@@ ed by a string enforcement filter .

the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download and t@@ t the package . &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . in addition , you will find the source code from k@@ dec@@ eit under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
you can find a list of all currently supported languages on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of languages above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for XML ; but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; t@@ t , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the pack@@ ets k@@ deli@@ bs and the program files for the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for dec@@ lines , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check whether speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech tags is possible directly and the sp@@ d @-@ conf script is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can go back to set or paragraph style , repeat , stop or cancel the output .
if an application is text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ons ; a speaker chooses , you &apos;ll see in .
if you click on the Ad@@ ding Spe@@ aker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card reader device will be displayed . for example , below is the setup of the module for festival Interactive . details of the modules can be found at .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you just have to enter festival .
select the string encoding for text that is passed to the festival . if you are aware of the fact that Western languages are known ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these slider controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display this gray , the voice selected does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( on larger memory consumption ) the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet created a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of Oc@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon in the system section will be visible after the start , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the just edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card speaker .
using the buttons in this row , you can pre or return on the order listed in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
text orders are listed and managed here . expendi@@ tures of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . learn more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts without support for the appropriate audio module ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equals about half and 200@@ X ; % about twice the normal speech speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the reserved jobs are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks breaking news . if you like &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text assignment is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card pass only apply to normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings , and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ No@@ tify messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications . the map displays noti@@ fications .
select this check@@ box to turn on &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are dict@@ ated by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired subscri@@ ber . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map card speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for selecting text for voice output . this standard includes marks for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into individual sets . this allows &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first sentence has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limits detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; when default , a set @-@ border detection filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further set limits filter , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker cho@@ oser and enter text for reading . switch the speaker cho@@ oser , change some properties and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . of course , you must have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long ,
you can then stop or ab@@ ort text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ation mark filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set @-@ limit filter filter out of default , you can paste it again by loading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection menu allows you to over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top of the board card speaker ) . in other words , no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the subscri@@ ber &apos;s settings , choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker fails . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best meets the original features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the characteristics of the desired subscri@@ ber . if this property does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that sent in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use the speaker closest to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text assignment in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved by this , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall gam@@ ers .
the audio output on AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , Fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; ein . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem with AL@@ SA conflicts that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please visit the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ st@@ / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the card card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for subscri@@ ber equipment . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the speech speed settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read them . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML transform@@ er@@ filters , and set the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t want websites to be read with a female voice . I have created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags for converting the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber die GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate collection filter and now I can go back or go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set forward or backward . on the box of the box orders will be displayed , the order only consist of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be filtered . instead , use a filter to mark the punc@@ tu@@ ation mark .

the following modules for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option to switch off displays the configure parameter which causes the transition .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions supplied with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like e.g. ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German lyrics .
this process adds additional wra@@ pper code to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 the recording of the bug fixes is not required , you only need to rebuild the festival ) . then add the following lines to the festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .
( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; ) ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; ) ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 3 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give language over festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; grab and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which enables administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a standardized , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the network configuration module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows the setting of network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module will be loaded if the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list which best meets distribution and release status . by marking the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the definition can be made permanently . when the network settings are started , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode you enter system management mode at the bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s :
the network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . the following tasks can be carried out by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box can be edited .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with other options .
with automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the Select Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as needed . turn on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be enabled or disabled as needed . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or modified . DNS records can be added , removed or modified . DNS records can be re @-@ ordered by selecting an entry and up or down gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ on or Her@@ under in priority .
by clicking the Add ... from the group Computer to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group machine to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will appear the Edit dialog .
the list of well @-@ known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily during bo@@ oting when there is no DNS server available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
the list usually contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New alias dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... Edit the dialog box to edit the dialog .
you can execute one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , it must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command will be set off .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the completed compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files will be discussed .
this area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed to a small ( home ) network .
at present IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be found . in external networks , on and eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the point of contact that specifies a valid IP address or , if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to experience time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first order was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a band can be used , it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
detects &amp; dat ; the template searches it according to the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the end of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; D ; by modi@@ fying the symbol for the tape , indicates that the mounting for the tape has been loos@@ ened and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a band of &amp; dat ; can be used , it needs to be format@@ ted by &amp; dat ;
a belt type must be format@@ ted before you can use it for storing data . this process does not conform to the format of the tape . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before using it , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives however do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape fort . all the data on the tape are lost ! upon completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically included and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
when you confirm the settings , the Save dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the In@@ sert menu item .
once the inspection process is started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog will appear to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog box appears for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
when you confirm the restore settings , the restore appears . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under Backup Files , only the files in it are backed up as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must reference the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command load load to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before read@@ - or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try and block the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected when loos@@ ening the mount . do not use this option on floppy disks .
not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted a tape , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about issues that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , on information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol . if this is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log directory , which normally does not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set strings . add a string line to the filter bar . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so only log lines are displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed when one of the columns is the string of the filter search term .
you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , in the Protocol File System Protocol , select the column process , and additionally , in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so you show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . log lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as the protocol lines of the Level Note . the color representation of log lines can be turned off settings dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to add new lines in the main window context menu to display all new add @-@ in lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following directory : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is quickly becoming a standard for the control of program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and that &apos;s because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not on / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting it . the &amp; Linux ; kernel first looks at / etc after an in@@ it file . so you must make sure the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you would like to start when moving the system or when changing to another Run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following in the initial section :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can change / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a little mess@@ ed up , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would pause the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of Available Systems Services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it anywhere else . the entry will be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved when you move them to a new area . to copy them to a new entry level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available Systems Services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine is running steadily again . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or mis@@ placed .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card map will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes .
the card password management appears in case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if for at least one embedded fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limited number of limitations in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space restriction
the card groups inform about the group dependen@@ cies of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog provides a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , change the time to boot from the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
