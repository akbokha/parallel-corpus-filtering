<seg id="1">The module page can be translated in the & konqueror; menu under Extras website. select the output and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the location of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the web can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror, which are easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, choose settings extensions.... Open the box card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard modules from the box kde; addons. please note that you may have more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & konqueror; on Extras crash. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Query Filter module (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras requirements filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView is to present nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles possess meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View Color Mode can either show depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property like name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation or whether the area of sub-orderly rectangles occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of Treemaps for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. there are frames drawn to avoid the nesting of entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is necessary for labelling and avoidance of space losses through frames always advantageous to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu item View stop at area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line has a slider and a script to adjust the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">To view the filename of the image, specify whether the file names are shown below the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the view box file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Click on the image size checkbox to see if the size of the images is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the folder folder, specify where the gallery is saved and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder you can set up with a slider or a script, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the gallery to copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth you can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be set here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu in the navigation pane window or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the & konqueror navigation pane and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need to call MSIE browser identifier to use the & konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are displayed correctly using this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the inserted browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the item entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; -Style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check menu under Extras website. you can perform the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check whether your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this check you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; with valid CSS; your web pages have a uniform look independent of the browser being used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your site on forwarding instructions and faulty connections. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; -Style templates.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web Archiver for & konqueror; you can save websites with text and images in .format format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Extras website with the mouse and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digities.more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitized; together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitized; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. processing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitised; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you are using these links, your web browser will open a page in the fault reporting system. all the information you need is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitized; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digitized, then we would like to answer you questions to other users of & digitized; however, you may soon answer questions of other users themselves. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitites; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digitised; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for announcing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitised; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or removable folder. just enter the path name or click the Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the databnk is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digitized; will also be used as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam setup collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder. & digitized; see every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. during browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitized; Durseeks recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders, unless it is in hidden folders. you can do this by inserting a dot in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon. this will then be used as an album symbol.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the basic folder, you can set up your digital camera in & digitized. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh Workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digities.more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digitized; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission.</seg>
<seg id="75">Digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support for reliably reading the thumbnails from digiKam. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digitised is how easy it can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitized;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digikam; themselves perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strips with & LMB; or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put a picture in another part of the Albenbault, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view. so the filtering on the filename only works if this ind is displayed as a symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSetup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. just select Album Import Pictures. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it. in the pop-up menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to share information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to highlight your albums, so that you can group them under a common name. the collection you used will be used to sort your photos by selecting collection from the toolbars or sorting pictures by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums By date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Buttons Elder, average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the section of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digitised, the first picture in the album will be shown as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, choose. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections can not be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all the pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying buttons on the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the respective preview. what information these are, you can change over Settings digitipped; set up the albums page and customize the preview area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have auxiliary windows, which appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important properties including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all, what it is about & digitised; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose any functions that are with & digitized; you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or edit the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... Select. in the editing section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digitized; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the application from the sub-menu of opening. for this, and how to adjust them to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur. some programs do not save these data when you save the changed image. this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">The easiest way is to click on the thumbnail with the right mouse button. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to the garbage dump of & kde; moved. F8 Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslime quot; organizes your photos using the data. & digitized; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or finding a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list; folding so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and allocated keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also re-import your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting Edit keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the images and select keyword lists from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can select a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the photo context menu and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, click the lower rectangle of the timeline, which displays the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">You can enter a title in the field below and save your selection. this will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Mitigating the search box is a small lamp that will be green when finding hits. if you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion. after saving it, it will filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your search again, you just have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit the search, the search form will be displayed again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as an advanced search, the dialog for Advanced search will appear. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Clear in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed by operators separate, added. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations all..., One..., No... or at least... you can create searches of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one. by means of a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digitised; find the right pictures. also here can be set a swellbook.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem illuminated table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window is opened. if you are back in & digitized; main window, you can quickly open the light table with L Extras lightable.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy you want to see in which window pane.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you are using pairing from the toolbar, the two first pictures will be automatically loaded into the area. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it on the left. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click them and hold the & LMB; then, in the preview, both pictures will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are previewed in the Preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers any part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads to a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images, find, protect and use pictures again. we consider downloading, rename, remove, convert, group, secure, validate, archive, store, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Inventory administration takes up, indexed, categorised, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exports content having a monetary or cultural value; quot; quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use digitized;. the approach to save metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide if you want to have access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday images can be quickly found through your location unless you were in one year several times at the same location. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then export is a folder for pictures you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant feed of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the metadata settings page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the respective item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now choose any photo keywords, captions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically insert the tree for you or insert images in the right place. the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very rough representation, since every block of metadata exists in truth out of many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance, there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look closer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this one of the allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you are moving to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8) as a caption. if you export your images to web galleries, then these captions are exported to your wishes into the label and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find yourself in another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now already drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that someday, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips by pictures with geographic indications. & digitized; can also export kml files you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author line): associated with the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples can be titles like: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a remark to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this doesn't necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you can see the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this, in the image. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, current breaches, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, extended superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you will find problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll OnTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics on what reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you can no longer trust you for a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control sum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control environments. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called Isobuster that apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8,5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slow down with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. afterwards, read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark-dry and protected environment. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Your manufacturer's warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: diskette study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause, SMART is the most common fault cause, SMART is the most common fault cause, SMART is the most common fault cause, SMART is the most common cause of errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not make a lot of power, this can take heavy damage on devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause perplexed keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. thus protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it complies with the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to ensuring that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thereby protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a wearable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a surge protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a non-stop power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against surge, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow them to continue working until the current is running. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can get a high quality overvoltage protection up to & euro; 20 costs, One 500W UPS you can pay for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference when you remember how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are however very expensive compared to hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services which are limited to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs, at least, ensure data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one GPL compatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that use ZFS and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% for workstation systems. in notebooks, the share of thieves is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or re-installation. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: untrue, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: incorrect, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. this means that while the technology is developing, there is a natural border for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you have any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, changing disks or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Assume you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash fails you'll be lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airspace: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desasters always means a non-local storage. bring up your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to detect and restore any losses. at the same time, you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, associated XMP files, retained original, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to look carefully and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to behave as a certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available to everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your machine architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means to increase.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have included the scalability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system but do not mount it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBGT; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of / dev / dev / sdc / dev / sdc # source</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create them yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG can be used as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf, and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and has a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open raw format format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. but it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, the raw format can be old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from camera, card reader or scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a fine-layered editing. if you edit the pictures again with & digitized, then you should add the metadata again. these were sometimes cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, code to MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised. in the section Adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitised; to use, connect these to your computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. for some cameras it may take a while. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file allocation for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that not all information is available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digitized; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the All Photos. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digitized;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, just select the desired & kde default selection methods. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download Selected. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New downloadable is available. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you want to download the All Files or Select All Selected, a dialog will appear with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums tab. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitis; loads the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete Delete button. if you only want to delete some, then you must select them first and then use Delete Selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check whether the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digitised version; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this over the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording series into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based submites. if you are using this latter option, a folder will automatically be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three additional options which are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data to the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-%% Y% H:% M:% S in the edit field. turn on the option Date & Time. for further customization you should read the command strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name option, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitised; used for a photo, is displayed beneath the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all information on the orientation of the camera to time point recording to perform automatic turning during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually switched on, and when your camera does not deliver this information, & digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, it can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all pictures with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digitised; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kd; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digikam; you where the pictures should be uploaded. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the pictures are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the identification of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to cartographiate an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitized; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or simply want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. the question is therefore actually more how the data enters these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, through a post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and finally about manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the GPX format, as this is the only format that is supported by the geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of pictures and GPS. on the following page you can do the same as & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the default coordinates that are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitized; tries to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digities. to access these settings, you need to select in the Edit menu. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select promotion can be set to preview or start image editing. in doing so, you specify the default behavior of & digitized; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional description of the photographer. this can be names like e.g. hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not need to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data into the corresponding IPTC field. this achieves that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digitized; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image resolution as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos using the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appear when the mouse cursor stays in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to indicate, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a & digitized; album folder that has none of these extensions, from & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The option & quot; In the entire image size, you can only use different sizes and the synchronous mode. if you have one, then you can get better visual results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. that means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file option, you can decompress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect image quality since the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Loss-free JPEG 2000 files can save you lossless. even if you select the lossless settings, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digitized, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is rapidly evolving into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if using this option, the pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the pointed-lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned, because of the inability of your camera to capture the pointed-lights as a continuous white. the setting colors will produce some unusual results, since they can reconstruct the highlights in various rosettes. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shrews.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digitis; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When selecting the Recreconstructs option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adjusted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can be done later in the editing options of the & digitizer; to keep the time for the demo version small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image processing algorithm to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading, since it is performed during raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return it. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space in the other is to translate the colors as accurately as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture opens in image editing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets the folder such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles. & digitized; then check this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are not managed the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain color tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options such as the Soft-Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image of a device would be returned. this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style of the destination recognisable: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image editing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from & digitized; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Setting Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes place the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all cameras supported at the left hand side. on the right side there is a button Automatic Detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the display mode. currently, serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB- or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable to mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digitised; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digitized; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the trash bin you can indicate the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly used by & digikam; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without queries. otherwise, you must save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digitize the display of the welcome screen; under certain circumstances, this speeds up the start process of & digitis;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start after new photos compels & digitized; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digitized;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, it asks & digikam, whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digitized; used to customize the main window to suit your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings design. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digitized; to create, find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">The image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitized; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, please refer to the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file saving or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this using File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using Recover or Restore the button The Restore image processing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last storage.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be reversed or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Return or Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl-Z, and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; click the Return or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge Automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you will see the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar will be displayed. if you do not want this, you can view this in the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print image in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole phrases. you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select Export Assistant from the Album Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digitized; main window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation files, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again in the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">Once you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to rate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the words used earlier in this & digitized; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the input keyword. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate tick boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you have multiple images selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not on the entire selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - datum-, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it to the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they have been selected using Ctrl + a, and afterwards a keyword is drawn from the right stitch tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you typically have created and created it, and find that it would have to be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the rules section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an extended search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable variance of the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme is applied to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, ink management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with more information about colour management. in addition, you should make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life for everyone so easy, why should one use another color space and have to think about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, then visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to callicker my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB is callibrated on sRGB. if you work as in the colour space of sRGB, you must either callibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">You will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminous intensity values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point becomes as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magnetic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusts the brightness range of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that produces either miracles in a picture or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright fronts and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the highest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited as a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. they start it from the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">A histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or also dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the controls mentioned above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set you can save it in a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find a color grading in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digicode; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar ionization, also called Sabatier, was an effect created by adding a partially developed pressure to a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar ionization. at about 50% intensity the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to generate on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaot; it differs from a saturation because it has a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. for large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can view the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of raising it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tonality correction is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of sliders for the application described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel, or the selected area. below the graph, three sliders are clicked into that and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera the linear representation is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. the compression of the output values can be used, for example, to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be stored and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, resources and suntones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the histogram's input values for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwave to the right, for example the bright sounds, then you can see that these bright notes correspond with darker output tones and darker the corresponding pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line will be displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and off until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you have created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is Gimp's curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes, automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and Luminanzcurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you will get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the Luminanzcanal. shade and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digitized; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are on the right side: knobs for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness even if you activate the corresponding color components. this is especially handy if you also have the option Monochrome, as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. the color space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same position in the color channel and their noise patterns appear differently in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. you can save any blender settings for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's no effect on seeing the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is stored. the original image is below (1) and the edited image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating due to your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lenticfilter. this looks good, with all scenes and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. thus, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. thus, similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Gelbfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithelia: produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the shading stems. this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digitized; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a wall picture on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect was applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed in (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digitizer; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter set the desired frame type for your picture. permanently, the image transforms with a colored line, niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonhole and decorative add an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing images, especially if you have previously used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any place. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with your mouse. use text style, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the OK button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digitized; tools template apply you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Template Apply in Image Processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil / digitized database, just send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the knob basic folder. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears which mirrors the folder structure of the box folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the preview bar of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Resize: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to make the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template onto your picture. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it produces grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred Mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychedeluell. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocused is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of the sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution are combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this in turn causes sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when colors are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG pictures a camera is often used internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners have a field of sharpness already during reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. you can use the Correcting Field menu item to view this.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften softness with the menu item Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and impression of grates will create near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radii. therefore, you should therefore best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount is equal to the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, one can define a minimal difference thus for an edge of the filter applied. thus, areas with a soft switch between the tones are exempt from sharpening and therefore avoid beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocused mostly achieves better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fission works much better than the Gauss's fold. the Gauss's fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality becomes very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is' sch '. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for circular sharpness or the gauze's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Kbuttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutters, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible, but which later left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking of a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider smoothes the blurring of the area which has been darkened so as to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inspectus was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. whereas larger values mainly smoothing and sharp detail. a value of 0.9 should obtain details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Leveling dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD images a high value will generate a high value. JPEG Artefacts are best removed with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is much noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle increment da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles create a long run time. therefore, you should make this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to exit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Upload buttons make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors with small artefacts are corrected. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City by an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact that is caused by a poor film storage during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">The following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blurred the image. the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine luminance changes. if the value is increased, you may need to adjust the edges -filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and noise or lubricate occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can not be removed or noise peaks may occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a low noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically smoked more strongly.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines as quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts on variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high a blurring may occur. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at the edges. it can remove rough tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used precisely for this purpose. all parameters for the reduction of the noise you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected one (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften softness with the menu item Correct softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Upload buttons make this exactly. every setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera to a Ilford (tm) 700si camera with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granulation on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected one below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digitised tool Hotpixel allows Hotpixel photos that were used with a CCD camera close to eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you capture the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the picture to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard knows the last dark and will automatically load it back in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1 dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area uniformly. instead & quot; vignetting quotot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 in the iris filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and color and gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the mold vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity damping at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, reduce it to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. you only have positive values at your disposal, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digitized; image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitised version is a tool for correcting the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second grader coefficients the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometrical distortion can almost be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second grades. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth grade. this value works more strongly on margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameter' has the reverse signature of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be obvious to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to view the dotted lines. move it to an important place like the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at that point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a vertex-shaped distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Remove cropping from the image editing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film from the Gimpanzu.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IIR-film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for previewing. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Few Movie Arrangement if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-red filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicode; filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies, producers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere loosened from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular sight especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO Sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film body effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; oil painting filter creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digicode; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and style-life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digicode; filter coal drawing utilizes color and intensity gradients to create a carbon escalator. images whose gradients vary slowly are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sketch for you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon labelling filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Digitized; Filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">Digitized; Filter engraving is a quick tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works very well in pictures with a simple structure, where color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monastic landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Toughness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurred the image by turning the pixel around one point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of unfocused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. as the drop size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digitised; image processing one area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter Regentropfen, the range will remain free from raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it through mirrors or turning into the correct orientation. the tools can be found in the menu Transformers Rotating or Transformers mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Blowing photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here does a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the Transformation size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Upload buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any recording for photo enlarges can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard enlargement compared.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put a picture together. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cut-out button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait aspect or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cutting uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to center the selection automatically horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. ratio knob to set the range to the greatest possible depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Folder aspect ratio saves his settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on the orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settling help settings allow help to fade, so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles: harmonic sections are based on the principle of similarity. like the third angel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who constructed their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the descending divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid guides when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will help you achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye focuses on the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the middle-points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no concurrent triangles. diagonal to place these lines can be released a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break your frame create an effect that is termed by professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you can't achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the digitised; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the tilt angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you move it over an important point of the image, you can fix it by pressing the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Auto Cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recalculated. on the right-hand side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New Height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle on top left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle on the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle on the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle on the right side: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is a bit lubricated. for a single adaptation, this effect is small but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you will get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming crop cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformer scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by dragging the horizontal and vertical angle. you can shift horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press on presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">Move your mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single shear, this effect is mostly negligible, but two sheaths satisfy twice as much knowledge and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear, the picture has triangular triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming crop cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">Digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">This is done based on file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digitized; the file extension is edited; you can change this list of file extensions. see the configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG under the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save losses when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guidances in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use digitized modules.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in & digitized; your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refocused, unsharp mask, & etc.. use a unified dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applied quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo Properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive mapping tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this is of course presupposed that your pictures contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& coloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Palettes files installed by & kde can be applied either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are located in your personal folder for & kde; -Settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the Select Palette you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view. it can be moved by clicked on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color next to it. the color is described under the pallet view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the checkbox Beim Cursor is activated by the button Color, the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites a different one; depending on whether the mode is overwriting selected, you can set this mode by selecting the box overwrite under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection, which was created as described in the last section, can be used along with the copying, cut and paste actions.</seg>

<seg id="725">& graph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& graph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kph viewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; recomputes the graphs and displays them in & kph;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kph; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting at about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kph viewer; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & Dot; for the representation of the graph. needs are in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoom is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be recharged or if you want to ignore the change. & kph viewer; can also remember your decision so that later on. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kph viewer; set up... also see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a graph file outside a running & kph viewer; -Instance, eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you will have the choice whether you want to open a new & kph viewer; -Instance or to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but these can also be changed using the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page will be construed to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load site gives the option to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">You can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that every time a graph is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management site provides the option to set the startup behavior of & kgraphs; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the last session files) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with one click in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; layout algorithm. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">It produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directed graph. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-executed graphs. it produces images according to the spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm produces a spring-spring model layout for uncreated graphs. it uses the Fruchterman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a multi-purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell. the command should specify the graphene file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for each type (dot; for directed, & neato; for non-executed graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the mouse pointer. with this mouse pointer click on a & GUI; -element to get more help to this element (if available).</seg>

<seg id="759">& kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools for display. it needs the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kph viewer; in the Settings menu you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid network in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new symbol. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. then a dialog appears in which you can choose whether to create the icon from a template, or whether you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this you need to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears, which lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default values for your own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and customize the area to suit your needs before using the button Scan to view the image. you will find the estimated file size in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is displayed completely as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan, you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen Photo... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">When all of your program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked up the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screenshot will be waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the internet. with Flickr it is possible to show his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera's phone online and show your photos safe and private your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are led through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is virtually your reference to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you click Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you need write permissions. the module now also does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>

<seg id="809">The CIPI module for geographical localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localisation can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS lane as an XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographic localization correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and run the menu. the above-to-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localisation, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were taken at the same places as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is carried out which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdates are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a locomotive is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlations to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same location. since the dialog shows the coordinates of one call to the next you just have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the map shown below. select the region in question and enlarge it. then, select this region and increase it again and again until you have reached a satisfactory level of accuracy. the map can always be selected manually between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages conforming to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not shown hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right side, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images is also saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. it naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails that are small images that are shown in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module generated pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Image Viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been designed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you can select the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodiver Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodiver module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV to slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are listed under Image Files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to return the file to a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the created file can be set under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as close as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file named the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your wishes, you can start the generation of the movie with the button encoding. depending on your computer's speed, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button on the bottom right corner.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dscw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images frequently or later use them further, you should not choose the JPEG format, since there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical with the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the star number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print Preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using the button images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and drop them there to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Remove images from the list of images to send.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of emails to send. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not be closed automatically to view the status messages when searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. you can close this window with the Connect button.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow there will be a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can select here between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant picture transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly choose that the images are displayed in a random order. so, it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly select another effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slideshow you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move your mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Background image is a tool for setting a picture as wallpaper for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can start with & kPhotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, now there are entries in each group, so in people, places and group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons can be seen. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view images of your area of influence.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol before their name. you can save with & kPhotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which is of course also valid for places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see also the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not own suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to choose which image for each individual person to be displayed. to do this, you need to select the image-view window (in more detail) and select the categories editor in the context menu. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the search entry in the main window, a dialog will show you that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can search all the images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. here, according to images on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user's manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and watch the fast entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialogue, if you start & kPhotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry in the menu Help menu. then, some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & photoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & photoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kPhotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used in the following ways: you can change the displayed preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of that date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this period will be displayed in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is included in & photoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described, which you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas contents, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description containing the HTML file later. on photoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & photoalbum; export file will be created to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages, so you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all images are of a party. note that all images are exported from a party. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not dealt with specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can scan your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if these really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages were created. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to it. thus, the Import function, see, right works, you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described are related to all three root folders or URLs. a subfolder is created in this folder, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; come together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time for it the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to start with & kPhotoalbum; this work does not even do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the images together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have provided when creating HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file by HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images that you can view from the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual to copy to the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy the .kim file to the .kim file, the images will automatically be copied for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. as most pictures were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option on this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import..., it will import & kPhotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The import wizard consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder you want to import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category individuals of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is written to your database people. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be to browse and view pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the different steps from (1) set up the information about your images, about (2) browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today your videos are taking care of. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Photoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the top of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g., normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& Photoalbum; records the folder where your images are stored and will automatically use it in future starts. if you want to read another folder with pictures, you can start & kPhotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: photoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Set up menu entry Settings... Get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help that you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog which is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories are already mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog you can set up complete members groups, i.e., for example, set up all members of a group at once instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; its modular system shares with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be invoked through the module menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that modules with & kPhotoalbum; only very little have been tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database first before you use them on your own imager & kPhotoalbum; demo database can be accessed either through the command line using the command &gt; kPhotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications incorporate their images into albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kPhotoalbum; this sort of order does not support, it simulates the order of albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thereby simulating & photoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all pictures showing you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, I have to give the modules a list of albums, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & szphotoalbum; s browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums. for example, if you are using the category people, you will have to do so, so whether you would have selected people to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kPhotoAlbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the Setup dialog and select in the module modules which modules you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kPhotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. currently, it does not contain too much information, since you have not yet entered information about your images. in the section we will come back to this window, but now click on the entry Add images to show you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the picture was taken. for example, you can use each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. for example, on all images of Jesper, and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum; as you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 images the same 5-10 people, you can find that the names used are moved up, the people find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting symbol by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located below the thumbnail on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window showing the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog's context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Excel or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to make it to a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the boxes that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it out of the pane area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are happy with the settings, click on the Options button... which allows you to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in your browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you have not set a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as wallpaper for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you haven't yet opened a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Clear in the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">Photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kPhotoalbum; namely images also without saving you on your hard drive. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere, so & kPhotoalbum; you can view the view of & photoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are present for the images 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so you can preview these images. however, you can not view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into. & kPhotoalbum; if you want to avoid mixing your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible and click on Current View in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way you have set out which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, so all the pictures you have blocked will be hidden. if you want to retrieve the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & photoalbum; over a picture _ and video viewer. these can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and discard it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether you want to display information at all. all these options are available right-click on the viewer. the appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images uploaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and the end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are uploaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kPhotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it's possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can move in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can pull out a rectangle with the mouse. use the Minus key to zoom out again. the plus button zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation key, the zoom is placed, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work on videos play in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can rotate the image using the script functions from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to place on the picture. at the moment you can view the snapshot and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to mark only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the images on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while viewing them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in this you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are placed.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so if you have all the images you want to edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply complete all of them at once with notes. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you can view categories in the preview screen, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>

<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodelling; you need to use the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to enable you to choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply, or discard changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; input user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; -Reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture. as default, the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a sub-arranged item. if you only want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you do not like the standard window arrangement, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, drag the sharer to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the path to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, drag the sharer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the splash to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window Order... Save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodelling; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. when this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodelling; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon at the toolbar, or select the Rendering menu item View.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or select Render Modi... from the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image editing for rendering in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray each pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as default an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling includes the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive recursive; recursively because each pixel is split again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 extra points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are separately pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection computes. it takes very long to let a scene compute with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map, you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated radiation does not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray / Scene, select File Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodelling; not yet the complete set of commands of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur while importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodelling; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeling; renders a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodelling; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. here you will find the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the directory of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points onto the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and spins.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for advanced projections, all the wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach to the projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the floor is displayed in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. in the section Render-Modi, you can specify the values for depth and threshold.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the section window configurations will explain how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Panel Standard Window Order: displays all existing window configurations. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window arrangement shows all existing window configurations. a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all the views for the selected window order. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you will anchor the window under the existing window, with map card you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodelling; installs and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you will receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't want to add light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything correctly installed, see the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following preset window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get an idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. thus you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera considers the whole scene you create. this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the destination point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Appden button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately in accordance with these settings. as a result, you can see the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a Quader (Insert Last Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodelling; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as a ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can flatten the item for the bottom when you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, turning and shifting. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit beneath the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how the object should be inserted. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = base pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment will only show a matte black material, because you can still check the pigment settings. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on Preview. also, there are many possibilities, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then invoke the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the bottom is now set correctly. if you render your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are more settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, choose one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to perform this step as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodelling; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the enter key or the button), so the ball would float above the ground, as you have shifted the bottom to one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subjects and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on the Pigment ball, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some Finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome surfaces even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodelling. hopefully, you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a rendering method to create a two dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog occur.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye, with which you see the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be added to this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since last storage have been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last revert command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new layout or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeling;, here you can change the look, key shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to change predefined shortcuts for & kpovmodeling; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodelling.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to preamend rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser where you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; -Shortcuts work. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and should describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all required modules are present and use kdialog to tell the user why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. this is usually done using the exec () function. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is picked up. the script could now and zb; use DCOP functions to query more information about the new piece (for example, metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected playlist files, if a custom menu entry can be clicked. to remove one entry, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove one entry.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ending, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the suffocation of amarokscript. for this reason you should name your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it at www.kde-apps.org and follow the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist, instead of having to work through endless menus. maybe you just search for a specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the basic folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake, you shouldn't have any trouble when you compile it. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options you can enable or disable at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies need to be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If the option is off, only the playlists window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1215">Other browsers use: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When saving playlists while moving, the current playlist automatically saves when ending & Amarok; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you enable this setting, use & Amarok; relative paths to music files starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date pieces when changing the piece of play, that the playlists window will pop up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window pane.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can customize & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok, set. by marking the own fonts, the otherwise gray presented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following range: playlists, player windows and context browsers. click Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. to do this, use the color selector activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when starting & Amarok; after program start playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped during the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if the colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below is a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify on which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders that & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the scalloyed as well as their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). an incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The portion of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further equipment is needed in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, under Port: the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card card last.fm addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok to transmit the names of played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the each played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; do some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org and then append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version were compiled. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this will lead to crashes while editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable the machine. turn off if inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace to us by email (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information but do not label them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl die "File $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl-MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a well-known error in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten. please note that in some cases, you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting will show its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to make Amarok the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. for this, use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in Channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to search for help. please enter there only one error if you find something about fixing a bug in Amarok yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist will appear. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively hold the interface, the startup window has been converted to the statistic window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column needs to be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column evaluation. you can also use the shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right click on your selection and then select From Playlist Remove From the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and let it drop there just as you would like to do with other files.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, this really is true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question is: which media types does GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support pretty much every conceivable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoders are provided (for patent reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously stream audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. enable Sound Server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">KDE 3.2.x issues problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all components. run the follow-up registers to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if this does not help you can also ask in the IRC Channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (stop Amarok before!): - Download the ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with dest-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. if you are content with the playlist, the tree view will immediately save only the remaining matching entries. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save them with the help of the playlist to save them. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlists window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlists browser. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have the option to importing playlists, these playlists are already in the tree view. by right-clicking on a playlist, you will get different ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally, some additional packages will be listed which make work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, it also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok can be used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play or current stream. just below is the range, the playing time, bit rate, and sampling rate of the current piece. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can change by the available Analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons on the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or disables the playlists window while the EQ button is used to set up an equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of playback buttons, volume control, and play-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser shows different information regarding the current piece. its look can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreting. these three subwindows are explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may have noticed that the underpanel starts off. the information shown there are now divided into other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (optional statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running track, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to review the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information on the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourites of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information is to be displayed in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is still running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be saved in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com following the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces will be sorted according to interpreter and there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be sorted by genre first by genre and among them by interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-record your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This leases the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in queue - this feature inserts the selected pieces into the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked by a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transferring to the Media Player. see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / burn to CD - This means that the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files into the garbage dump... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation and then it appears among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up the compilation selection - change a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be shown under different performers but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to handle many playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow will be used for the connection of & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be included in / mnt / ipod before starting & Amarok; when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreting sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter. if you are done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is finished, stop & Amarok; and resolve the drive engagement for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because all files are hidden in the file list that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can pick music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is last longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping it. in this case, holding down the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically add dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop. once you enter characters, only the pieces are displayed that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separated search terms by whitespace, search & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you type for example one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR type between search words, search for entries that contain either the one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not after entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example, rating: &gt; 50. this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular keyword, set a minus sign in front of the keyword: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click in the desired order to the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left-hand side, you will find the Add button to which you can add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow reverberations and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1473">A previously selected DVD video can be converted. this dialog usually appears after reading a DVD in the table view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even possibilities to change the size and trim black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium, such as size and title length of CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, lock and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Table of Content allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the level view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs when a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view has open projects. the header strip has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change key assignments for & k3b; once you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard assignment further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. to do this, you need system administrator rights, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; general program settings can be made here. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of your task is crucial, which will give you preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; start. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; -program have common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and further functions for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createPhotoCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void copyDvd () void-formatDvd () void burnCdImage () void burnCdimage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then get a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void gurl (KURL:: list urls, QString parent) void reameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; -readers for & kde;. with it can easily be audio CD; s read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data into wav files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encoded these wav files (These Kodiers Packages must be installed from the Linux distribution). more Kodifiers can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format, or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other Kodivers must be installed. all these programs are generally available for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the Welsh Kodiver chapter gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read the audio data from CD & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device handle protection, it is not possible to handle a protected audio CD; even not the mechanisms of copy protection. avoid simply buying a copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily use to read a & CD; to the hard drive explains. this (hopefully) leads to understanding the slim approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble in at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which Kodiver programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can get & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or work completely without a network, everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the page step by step example, there are more information on how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be established first.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup alog - coding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it should be noted that previously the encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as read & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main alignment dialog of & kaudioCreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, for setting up the encoder). go here before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression ratios and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, differences become less important, since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is nevertheless provided free with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting yields good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and autostereoks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset InSane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated to most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or fetched by the program automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt must be added to lame and the title parameter of & kaudioCreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioCreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, download / enter the information, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the machine. it is worth noting that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; information that is publicly available on the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is active to dial a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address is not used when retrieving data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudioCreator; set up for use by freedb, the geographically closest reflection server is needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save to wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used for this; if you want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the Kodiver can be used. this is also necessary for predefined encoders. further information on Kodifiers can be found in the Welsh Kodiver chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device identifier of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read values on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flc & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset Extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine as it is not fully free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it (eg; by trying to copy something inside with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudioCreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset Extreme = &gt; VBR 224 up to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time you read a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read it the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device identifier of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of device designations for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map map General Settings. there's not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is as inlaid / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in the case of incomplete information, you will be informed, so that you will be informed if information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet during read-out of the & CD; it must be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is simpler, a & CD; entry is found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag records, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konquiter &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & node; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, it is over 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as concerns the server, as many firewalls bog the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously outgoing pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? read and code? the author does not know, therefore simply try.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this to the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore, or even a multi-processor machine, you can attempt to encoding more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic set up of & kaudioCreator; this configuration is used as a standard for any readout of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you will never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; which is running on the hard drive. we will create and set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we have a & CD, which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data you have fetched for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not the & CD; this example to find. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD; in the drive which has been defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, consult the section Questions and Answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully retrieved from the freedb, all titles are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic retrieval of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual commentaries per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are common for all songs of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudioCreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the read-out CD; in this example, this is not important as we don't transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "after choosing" "" "OK" "" "you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD editor window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked in this way are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or click the Select All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process is started by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you are trying to work with a coefficient you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has found no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that appears configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. in case of performance-weak machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem at the same time reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioCreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">& kaudioCreator; is maintained today within the & kde; CVS is part of the modem-driven package. however, if you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudioCreator; a part of an important & k; -package. if you read this, you probably have already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at persons who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it is running, then the following is true for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many options. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still to read? even if only the Help menu was clicked after the first-time start of the program, without any reference point as it should continue from this somewhat empty screen (especially if at the time of program start no audio CD; in the drive is), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiogenerator; it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudiogenerator; may it do. at least after making contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this proposal.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others it has a real-time graphic and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also support the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver that is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (such as song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session Support. if you end & kde; while playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window to the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button on the toolbar, select the play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; one piece automatically starts when you pull it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played together.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the slider.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows left and right of the template and adjust the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the play menu, interrupts playback. pressing the spacebar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two styles in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically retrieved for a song, so that you don't have to manually adjust the automatic text selection, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these will be played back in the series. in this section, you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find it in the menu item under the item Organize.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the counterfeit in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you exit the application, this collection is not stored. remember when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select collections from the submenu of the menu list, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next song, next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song, select the previous piece button, the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid; not stored.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map compiles General MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the Change patch to Bright Piano events into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always lets a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap..." END Define keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI's patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the note with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with a patch 127 (shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term drum patch refers to a different percussioning instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc.), and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (like some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as is their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and every instrument. you just have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to map sounds to the percussions-channel. for example, take a look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">PitchBenderRatio specifies where pitch-Bender-occurrences are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender-Event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is a pitch-Bender-Event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button will no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the Settings menu under the View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed, etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before you activate the setting automatically add the automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn on the automatic add to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.F., B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setup automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.C and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the university of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much free time for my hobbies but I'm trying to take some time. as a hobbies I have programming, collecting MIDI files, making music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension by & kmid; or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a huge joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will record with friends by & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I may already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and got money from anybody. I would like to point out that I only keep on programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AWE cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, which give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arracis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and view pictures. you will also find links to pages with further karaoke songs, & etc.</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, since the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If you encounter problems, contact one of our mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished as & kd; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections from the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to receive an additional hierarchy of hierarchies. when you select an entry, its group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' updates', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; you can also change the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory. simply click on a name of a category clicken, then select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlists from the same menu and select either the editing mode or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is abandoned or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by modifying the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and altering [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / ver.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; and lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; / Body; / lt; / Body; / Body; / Body; / Body; / Body; / Body; / Ssmiled; In the tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here, the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the 'console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaylistc, like setting up the backend by mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even include the special embed tag for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can be played in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave-flash in the Setup dialog File Regulations of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is used in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the Backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given backend for a certain Mime type (of course only if this is also determined), it must be done by changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplaylistc file. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be stowed, the device must be used and the TV channels need to be used. this can be used by the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be detected by which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer only can use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be working. for this reason, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by SMEs for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be run as root after plugging the device. it is absolutely sure that / dev / cdrom indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overpriced. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1752">As well as other labelling schemes include & latex; an introduction with which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry assistant of & Kile; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this allows the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], project projector [beamer], films [Prosper] or custom defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is used to set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8x should be selected (for correct processing of the latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex; for integration they need to be selected only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about this. only a short description of the functions and further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - as well as other source code editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Kile; if you see grated areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you may notice it by the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and pointer by highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic execution of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the added line to pass the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be disabled in the box settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the placing of the document into the following elements (part is the most common and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when a DVI; file is created, jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer becomes the appropriate line in the & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex; There are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the tag search, the elements of the DVI; file were used with the editor and as soon as an element was clicked in the DVI; file, the exact opposite is applied. as soon as a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding section is speckled in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be configured through project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick installation: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is at the end of the ndersâ and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbars, the three large selection boxes should be visible. the selection boxes have been developed for the quick installation of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as Tags, notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified name (selects a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; manually written.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection box with the name GrÃ ¶ .e is used for specifying the font size. you can specify the font size for the main text, the merges, etc. there are the following font sizes available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentarclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12 pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code needs to be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the volume construction or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; performs the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using rapid construction, & eyepiece should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (close environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another type of lettering. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the change of the font sizes inside the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are surveyed only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} up to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold print, passive printing, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics pressure and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be represented italic with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to write the source text with the & latex; markup language is presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for better readability of the document should be performed. for this, mind. a quotation, a few passages in bold and cursive pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor view or Ctrl-E can be converted back to the editor (the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ICE I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file, the same steps are necessary for creating the document (see). in the seventh step, after clicking on a DVI, the document can then be printed using file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; -Source text, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search string allows the direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -Binding files. for this only Modern under Settings box has to be set up... tools Building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the preferred search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on to search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document by & Kile; required and bound to the appropriate line. to do this, & Kile; in & eyepiece; defined as text editor (setting up eyepieces... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the user does not open the & DVI; viewer does not open, there may be errors. if an error occurs, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file contains the source code error source. in the editor you can use the spects' launcher LaTeX errors and NULL LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. to view the incorrect line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & Kile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Multilevel user of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template using the opening of an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings box... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering in document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ Documentary [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& box; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it; and to know its possibilities, the manual can be consulted from Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; -command reference, which can be called via LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; they can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double click with pressed Ctrl key to select the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumps within the text. this is a separate type of bookmarks inside the text. the menu edit jumps or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump mark is also highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offering excellent possibilities, have been added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; -Source texts; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only preventive thing in & Kile is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this option also has an extended meaning as this command also adds & latex; -commands with a back line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete part of the document, of course this can be selected first and be removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for a quicker possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is contained in the description to Edit Selection paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands in the Edit environment for a possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to stream the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the last opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by clasps {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the shredded clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curled clamp of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups brackets, the overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a seal. for the purpose-carrying implementation is used in & Kile; the character 'is used for two simple reference marks. also for ending the request the character' is' used. & Kile; 'knows this case and makes two closing notes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insert of double quotation marks can be set up under Setting box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">There can also be ad-specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and therewith German or French suits are used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; enter key & Kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment close & Kile; the current line with\\\\ closed with a close line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings box; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et-characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to enable this. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the adjacent row. although this tabulator does not belong to the table, add to the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offering a good source code execution, it has been added to & Kile; for special commands (mostly for natural latex;), different modes are installed. three of these work as needed and the other two are for automatic execution. all of these modes can be set for different modes of operation under Settings box... fully set up.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is executed using the command\\ begin {environment} & box; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, by default, the list is enlarged. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. however, the descriptions are also removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump handles may be added, so that a simple jump to these positions via edit jumps is possible and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; fulfills can be made settings to these lists. there can be different types of jars for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as books of general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin and the call of the default mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the execution of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the default mode over the edifying environment or key / key Alt + Shift key space, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile; recognizes that it is a lists environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... Kile; fulfills can be made settings to these lists. this mode uses the Waves List of the full-up mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of dependencies that are immediately replaced by lower strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... boxes can be set up. as an example of a cooling list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is initiated by the Edit menu, or the Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the character L will be replaced by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large Waves are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been found that many users in a document are written more than once. this provides & Kile; the full support for all the already written documents.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and reordering pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf in a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the result of work, the source code needs to be compiled. all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation of compiling, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the key, Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in the default viewer using Alt; 4, using Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1891">No or more parameters can be added to the LibXSLT parameter section of the dialog. this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style template.</seg>
<seg id="1892">In order to apply the recorded changes, press the button Ok. the squeezing of Cancel casts any changes.</seg>
<seg id="1893">The dialog can be closed by pressing X in the right upper corner of the window. if the settings are changed, you should open the dialog again.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Once the style template is started, the Debugging Inspect menu can be selected from the Debuggen menu. then click on the map tracker stopping points as shown in the example below.</seg>
<seg id="1895">A filename can be an absolute path to a local file. or only the filename (eg; xsldoc.xsl).</seg>
<seg id="1896">A template or mode name can be a fully qualified name, with which the non-local part is optional, e.g. xsl: mytemplate is also referred by mytemplate.</seg>
<seg id="1897">First click the fixing point to delete in the list of current stops. then press the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1898">The status of a certain feature is displayed in the corresponding text with a different background color. the desired color can be selected: see Editor Options dialog, on the Color page.</seg>
<seg id="1899">You can deactivate, deactivate or delete a holding point using keys, the Debug menu or the icons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Most of the output from & kxsldbg; will be captured and displayed either in the Inspect... Dialog or in & kxsldbg; output window. the following exceptions apply to this rule:</seg>
<seg id="1901">The different tools are available through the Debuggen menu, where the stage-management tool is most important.</seg>
<seg id="1902">By clicking on the step-by-step selection in the menu, a dialog for selecting the running speed will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1903">To stop the process, press the W button or select step-by-step in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1904">To consult a system ID in the current & XML; catalog, select System ID... in the menu and enter the value to be searched in the displayed dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1905">To add an publicID, select PublicID... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the dialog displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1906">If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debugging Inspizier... from the menu. to edit the sources, click on the tab bar source code in the dialog appearing.</seg>
<seg id="1907">All & XSLT; source files integrated by the & XSLT; file or their siblings are listed here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Clicking on a source item in the list shown puts the text cursor in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="1909">If the inspection dialog does not appear, select Debugging Inspizier... from the menu. to edit the sources, click on the tab bar source code in the dialog appearing.</seg>
<seg id="1910">All found templates are listed here. it is worth noting that the export rules of & XSLT are valid. therefore, multiple templates with the same matching and mode details can be present.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text cursor in the main window to the corresponding line of this file.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Local and global variables are shown on a map card in the Xsldbg-Inspector dialog. the following example shows XSLT source code in which a global and a local variable is declared.</seg>
<seg id="1913">By clicking on a variable from the list you get a summary information in the dialog below. if a variable expresses a particular expression, for example</seg>
<seg id="1914">Contains, then a new XPath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button.</seg>
<seg id="1915">When clicking on a variable entry in the list, the text cursor is moved to the corresponding line of this file in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 of & quantaplus; contains many new and XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration into & quantaplus, all of these tools are used as surface and libxml2 and libxslt as a base. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; -documentation knows me and how outstanding it is. raise it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more dependent on a terminal; simply clicked on and done the symbol for the XML processor!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is located in the weighed work folder, then leave the current working folder. if not, then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML files are deleted every time meinproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As already said, everyone who worked on the & kde; -documentation knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus; there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the just opened file is index.docbook then just leave it to the current working folder. if not, then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.docbook can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">If it comes to an output on the screen, your file is faulty. please check the reported errors and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then they let the current file simply be checked. if not, delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - File Selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file well-formed is, click the Well-formed Check Selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file, select & DTD; (internal), otherwise & DTD; (External) and specify the location of the & DTD; using definition URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; Schema as well as for the RelaxNG check is the specification of the definition URI; in the file selection required.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has a & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed in & quantaplus is already marked then they can be simply selected. if not, remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have been named. the file is usually stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, laughed, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. thus, the plug-in system becomes very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in & quantaplus. more about this can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start the Edit menu with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all plugins included and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location uses & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often several people work in a hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identities) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something is happening. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions performed when something specific occurs in the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing of the project, so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is saved, or a script that includes a file into CVS, once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressees selected in the receiver list. the address can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Enter comments is simple. you can either select the comment entry from the Editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with the nickname of the inserted nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project from the following possibilities: team Leader Subproject Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... called. this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Tags: large / Lumpy of automatically inserted tags. normal Gross / lower case means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Case-sensitive attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal Gross / lower case means that the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags, except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish day: if switched on, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic set-up of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetyps for detection of different types of files. resetting the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped), but this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that in case of a power failure or crash, the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a flashpoint), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview, and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to default at the next start is useful if the user interface is messed up by modifying the MDI modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, which represents the illustration of the parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the section of Structural Tree Settings, the visibility of knots in the tree, the update frequency of the tree while editing and how deeply in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such as no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for specifying abbreviations (a type of templates), which are unfolded in editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifty abbreviation signifies something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any kind-enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read Only" mode: check if the plugin refuses the load. only-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then select if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, since version 3.3, debugging has been completely newly developed. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead of this, a debugger plugin concept has been implemented which allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all mounting points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or a part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it shares the plug-in to listen to debugging demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debuck session Start the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Send an HTTP request to the server for a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output pane.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and constantly send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if the script is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution runs further. if it happens before a debit note is given, execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include is corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can customize & quantaplus; to adapt to your needs and how to help you & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they allow & quantaplus; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the & descriptionrc; and tag XML files with the extension .tag. toolbar, the text and instructions can be inserted more quickly into a document than a user may ever have.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbar. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the property dialog, the & quantaplus, for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without any risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid only for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other tag. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Specifies an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagame%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag to be defined. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an XML declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus, to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check occurs only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following, an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tag XML file is to be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; routine name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / day &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is as fairly simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. clicking New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User's button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with K1, the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but then it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), started. examples from & quantaplus, themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus is trying to find the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus, process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be attached to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be submitted by & quantaplus. in the input field entry can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages are directed to standard output. it can be specified what should be done with the text written to the standard output, by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure promotions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable dialog "Edit Day" when available so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics other programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, stared, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar and set the toolbars selected. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbars might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the proper folder. after New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc, so that its tool bar (s) is loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus - Repository whether someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.html tag 1 = tag2html tag 2 = tag2html tag 3 = tag2html tag</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own contents. there is no known boundary for the shaft depth (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently on the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but look for & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The contents section is the area of the docrc file used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the ContextList and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global usage. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that these are well and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the wasted resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or else to whom. in different places there is an email-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. to make an online contribution, we recommend using a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload your passphrase, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New Resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar, and start from the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it cautions and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the creator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML language that is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can start from menu DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in! doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to gain full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are stored for everyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree that are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emblends the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the cartons with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all flashpoints, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area to another context menu with respect to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse pointer, using the word under the mouse pointer or opening the file, when the string is termed a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building mansions (QIT;) make it possible to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree view.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions like adding, removing, uploading, or deleting files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects are available only in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of reintegration in Global, Local and Project works here as well. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element there is a list of commands related to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree-views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the entry system oriented to the content enables the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here's the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be appended, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two cartons at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus, toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command displayed. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbars as compressed tsar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can save and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest Web development tool for & kde! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why developing what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is provided with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list is changing every time you open a file that is not located on it, and the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts from clipboard there special characters to & HTML; spell checking so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily used to insert & URL; s in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection respectively. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. this is very useful if your & PHP; -script error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there, allowing you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, managed the project. in the chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbars. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this just creates the name. actions must be set by settings actions... added. tool bars are stored by toolbar toolbar, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removing a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't yet saved the toolbars, you'll be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team to allow the toolbar to be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; useful if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not available, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting the paste by toolbar if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on it. click an activated plug-in to disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS, or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different kinds of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes need time or not create nice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse pointer's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should best be filled from top to bottom, as for example after completing the project name the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all those paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project properties can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is empty, the default settings for the chosen protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default Toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc.) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be activated when files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your own discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be modified in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the Profiles subwindow or modified using Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries will be explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed can be selected. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles window, upload profiles can be set (see in) as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by clicking on its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior can't be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu project or the icon project will open from the toolbar. the Project dialog will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu called with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here different profiles can be selected. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button is blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten during programming. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the record store option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high loading profiles can be uploaded to different servers for the project (or parts of the project). when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this doesn't have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use them according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply dragging the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which you can do the most. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus, preferably stackable from the Tools menu. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is discussed below in the section Adding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, and other actions such as toolbar can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where it can be indicated which actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with settings... and specify the actions settings..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set up for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, images, & PDF; s, Flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents with links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, special documents will be created in appropriate subfolders. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be added to the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl base. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As a template Save As local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click Save as template Save as Local / Project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can set headlines and footers or dynamically connect to & PHP; create, insert files or associate with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Template subwindow is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / Shareand $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows leading or re-featured text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows by copying contents templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (shown to press right mouse button) over a full command library for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor that can be accessed through the View menu. first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second one shares the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; -editor. to edit & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes both in the source text editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor is active in the source text editor and in the VPL; -Editor is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure activates the active cursor from one window to the other, with the position being retained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set via Settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL; -View one can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small span for fast machines and a large span for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose the title of the website, so it is possible to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL; this will help reduce the manual encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by clicking on the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the return button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source code editor. it should be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars, such as the spreadsheet assistant or the lists wizard, are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; the tables or lists must be used in this release.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & crimp3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where the indentation could have changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & K diff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the reference windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a fully fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3 way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& -diff3; also helps in comparing and merging the complete folder. this screenshot shows & kspl3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& K diff3; displays exact differences and follow the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain amount of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are located in different folders, you can make typing easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">2-sided folder 1 Folder 2-o Destination Folder 2-o Destination Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 2 Folder 3 -o Destination Folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows you to manually type file names, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will notice your selection and show it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders will be initiated. however, if A file is selected, for B and C, a folder is then used, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setting button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & K diff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison will start immediately. in the open dialog you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & casdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at present, you can't get out of & diff3; pull out. only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three spring windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color Blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color which is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare single cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the merge column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is checked, the line will be shown on the dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparative windows) also has an info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [hits] when you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons sprint to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, every difference must also be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be shown in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this also causes a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.)</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; there is only one placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marking that you may perhaps copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. proceed with this function carefully.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources are ignored or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, side down, side down, end, Strg-beginning and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are also used by other programs. the oversight column next to the vertical scroll bar can be used by clicking on also for navigating.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Fork window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Strg-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Strg-Up) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option Selection automatically copy. if this is enabled, whatever you select is automatically copied to the clipboard and copying the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & casdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore it to the next start. (setup menu Settings &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences will be displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered asterily. on these systems, the preset button automatically creates an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the indentation of the previous line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual into the clipboard then drops.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. the second step compares each line. the second step compares each line. in this step, white signs are ignored. also when merging, white signs are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others save only a newline character, though they are different. if this option is checked, these options may be displayed with different sizes in the side-to-side comparison, but when merging, this option must be disabled. this option is disabled during default.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensely after even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before proceeding to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if the white signs in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merging menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and performing a merge. see documentation for the folder comparison and merge documentation for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if a backup file already exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to exit & chdiff3; stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding will be a brief indication of what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress signs of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; B, A & lt; & quot; C or B & lt; -C is displayed next to the normal yet another oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply exit the less important window. (this option is located in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default output file name. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & K diff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that fits exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal preprocessor command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the line of the line. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program this by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line letters to convert the input in uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulary expression that matches the found text in the first clamp.\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generating $\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line intercept. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' [and ']' is a hit, and every hit will be replaced by nothing, so virtually erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl. perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'Allerdings are different with perl some details differently. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-balancing algorithm considers.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and shows the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify the folders on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, uses & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed by a small message window about current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When the scanning of the folders is finished, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that was found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can fold a folder by double-clicking the + / - or by double-clicking on the + / - or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronizing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified and if the option to synchronize directories is active. then selects & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & coefficients; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (insecure) is selected, then examines & D diff3; the date of the files and performs the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after another. it displays status column when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode, B will be used as the target, the two folder merge is chosen as the target, and when synchronizing, A and / or B will be used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only select the current item, select Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merge actions, a message appears to indicate the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries a dialog box appears with the options, Simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Shiite if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& K diff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merging window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again / continue directory merge / continue or press F7. if you haven't yet saved, an appropriate dialog will pop up. then & k diff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & K diff3; put on an error, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem. if you continue merging (F7 key), you can select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries will not be merged once more. even if the merging has been skipped or not stored, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merging action, these entries will be merged once more.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many auto-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a default attribute. in other file systems, a leading dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively. (note that if the option contains a link to itself would lead to an infinite loop and & casdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of modification. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date is lost. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the results are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the copy of the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered insecure, because the knowledge is provided that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and obliterated .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view remains visible in the merging of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the directory & text window into main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge. by saving the result, the status will be set to Erlewronged and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative und. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of the limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date differ from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in KDiff3 part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & casdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; assumes that the input file has a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then & K diff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & casdiff3; performed as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folder is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff3 from the diff utility collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or that they will go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably did not tell the configure script to the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g., udiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white sign is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines are next to each other, this is this one is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the A / B / C button. this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger volumes of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src has been defeated; and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& K diff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & -diff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found at http: / / khat3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & chdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir displays the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, please refer to the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. inserting (Ctrl-V or Shift-Paste) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C labelling below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled in default. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the workspaces, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; motion is possible both inside a desktop and on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and end. if, however, on an application inside & Kpager; clicked, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries will minimise, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the name of the virtual desktops is displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this box lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are marked with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the current programs will be shown as small windows in the & Kpager; only empty areas are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main windows can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN raster, as from Pager applications in some other window managers appear; horizontal shows all virtual workspaces in a horizontal and vertical bar in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the work surface.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be altered in size, view and move windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and set up selector selector... Settings allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this can't be changed in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowTransparent fashion and assign a value to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen loupe. you can zoom a part of the screen, as if you read the newspaper a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new features. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnifying window. the image that appears in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a mobile magnifier. alternatively, you can create a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown window) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid pointing the mouse pointer in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In drop-down mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift, press the button or the & MMB; use, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window will remain fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the Update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window will appear. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is waiting for a while at the same location. it is intended to help people suffering from RSI's syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury Syndrome) and any mouse click prepares pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer is waiting for a while at the same location. it is meant to help people who suffer pain at the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and each mouse click emulate pain. however, it may emulate pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice however.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer. if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that is caused by moving the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, waits it to the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting area is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before it leaves the mouse button again when no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function activates, creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ current kes.txt, if & kmousetool; the first time is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can drag & kiss to shorten the response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the tab General. there is a slider-bar buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you already hit the user button, the settings will be reset to the level after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first of all with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be disabled first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to decrease in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keystroke. thus, accidental moving can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent moving is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible in this way to select text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; use it as follows: at the one end of the text area, select a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while moving the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is played every time & kmousetool; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shifting time starts when intelligent shifting. later you can use the intelligent shift also without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use, the XTest extension has to be installed for & X windows; this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker, and these are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to have a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released. thus, the drag and drop can also be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. when the output of the screen reader is read, the reserved jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can chat with & kmouth; Notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you send from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are executed as modules. in the future there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String translators replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with pre-defined string insertion filters such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable format.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files for the translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speakers selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE news about it. siee. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied to voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text application, a message, warning or a & kd; -notification is sent to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below. processing by the filters is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are processed in the range downwards from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting strings, you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text. upper and lower case is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Replace. the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the spokesman for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold the & Ctrl key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text is from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID is copied-3432, you can only type copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string enforcement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited to both sides by separations.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions to write regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can use it in the dialog or Edit as help to assemble these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility has to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the language selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker set up on the card board orator, or to a speaker with certain properties. for example, you can specify that text from kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & tts; there is a text to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program presets that sends the text to & ktts; the speaker is selected, and the characteristics of the speakers furnished on the card board. with the speaker selection filter, you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; -editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected, which best meets the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialog for Speaker Selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>

<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone so that Sable works at all. you must do that even if you do not use this voice for reading websites. also make sure that the program is installed xsltproc and can be found through the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation signs seem to cause errors at the synthesizer so that whole sentences are skipped or only chewing-catcher is spent. what can I do against it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with specific characters or words, these may be remedied by a string enforcement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of languages above may be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. check also on the website of ktts;, for information that is not yet included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-Dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & tts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used to support SSML and for XML; but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & tt, you need a current development environment of KDE (Version 3.4 or later) including the packets kdelibs and the program files for the program "speech-Dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for declines, or have downloaded the tarball currently created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts; first check whether speech-Dispatcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts. the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech tags is possible directly and the spd-conf script is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sets. the user can go back to set or paragraph style, repeat, stop or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application is text to & ktts, you can request an application for example a female English speaker. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be selected automatically. if you want to learn more about how & ktons; a speaker chooses, you'll see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the Adding Speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card reader device will be displayed. for example, below is the setup of the module for festival Interactive. details of the modules can be found at.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the string encoding for text that is passed to the festival. if you are aware of the fact that Western languages are known ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These slider controls allow you to adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display this gray, the voice selected does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as multi-syn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that (on larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet created a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of Octsmgr. otherwise, only the icon in the system section will be visible after the start, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr is not running yet, it will appear in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the just edited set. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Using the buttons in this row, you can pre or return on the order listed in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) are taken over and ttsmgr is reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to view the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out which device works with you. in doubt, select Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map, you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the output of the screen reader is read, the reserved jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks breaking news. if you like & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can chat with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output enters the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text assignment is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card pass only apply to normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings, and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read KNotify messages, launch kttsmgr and click Notifications. the map displays notifications.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Select this checkbox to turn on & kde. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played are dictated by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2718">You can enter here the characteristics of the desired subscriber. standard selects the speaker, which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map card speaker. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this, you can specify the default notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file. use the Load button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard for selecting text for voice output. this standard includes marks for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of voice and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British), since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the edition of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100M;%, SSML is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters (SDB filter). SBDs divide text into individual sets. this allows & ktts; faster with reading, since only the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limits detection filters. at the first start of & ktts; when default, a set-border detection filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add further set limits filter, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker chooser and enter text for reading. switch the speaker chooser, change some properties and check how the speaker's choice is changed. of course, you must have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or abort text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut down, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation mark filters compare text with a regular expression for bylaws and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -News (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set-limit filter filter out of default, you can paste it again by loading the default _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The Speaker Selection menu allows you to overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the board card speaker). in other words, no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the subscriber's settings, choose & ktts; this speaker fails. otherwise, & ktts; the speaker that best meets the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the desired subscriber. if this property does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than that sent in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the standard speaker selection button and then use the speaker closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text assignment in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, it may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall gamers.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output on ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, Friert & ktts; ein. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is a problem with ALSA conflicts that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but ttsmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalst/ vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the card card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesizers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card board for subscriber equipment. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The speech speed settings are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read them. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -according to SSML transformerfilters, and set the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't want websites to be read with a female voice. I have created a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-Tags for converting the SSML to Saber die GENDER-Tags. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate collection filter and now I can go back or go in & ktts; no longer set forward or backward. on the box of the box orders will be displayed, the order only consist of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (dot, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) may not be filtered. instead, use a filter to mark the punctuation mark.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by logging in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system also counts, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you stop a text job and then start another. you will find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">With July 2005, aKode does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text assignment in & ktts, the current set is still read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general adjustment of speech speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; -CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded and downloaded as tarball (with tar-packed archive), log in as normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4, the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is exposed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions supplied with Festival. if you want to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>

<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic like e.g. koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; synthesizer. then festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates these from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also generate Diphone from German lyrics.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which enables administration of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings using a standardized, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to enable users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the network configuration module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to make & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows the setting of network characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module will be loaded if the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list which best meets distribution and release status. by marking the setting of non-recurring questions, the definition can be made permanently. when the network settings are started, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in the system management mode you enter system management mode at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interface tab is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. the following tasks can be carried out by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with other options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the Select Manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface during booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as needed. turn on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be enabled or disabled as needed. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or modified. DNS records can be added, removed or modified. DNS records can be re-ordered by selecting an entry and up or down grading in the list with the buttons Hinon or Herunder in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add... from the group Computer to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group machine to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will appear the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of well-known hosts describes the hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily during booting when there is no DNS server available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">The list usually contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known computer has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known computer from the list and select Edit.... Edit the dialog box to edit the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can execute one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, it must be placed in a & console; the following command will be set off.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the completed compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a GUI can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changing configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed to a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">At present IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focussed on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is to be found. in external networks, on and eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact that specifies a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content to be found in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first order was to create a surface for tar which additionally offered the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be done by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the template searches it according to the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched through the end of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& D; by modifying the symbol for the tape, indicates that the mounting for the tape has been loosened and displays a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & dat; can be used, it needs to be formatted by & dat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A belt type must be formatted before you can use it for storing data. this process does not conform to the format of the tape. if your tape drive requires formatting before using it, this must happen before you are formatted by the tape. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of tape, DAT drives however do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the format of the tape fort. all the data on the tape are lost! upon completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically included and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the Save dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the Insert menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the inspection process is started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the review settings, the dialog will appear to be checked. this dialog shows the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog box appears for restoration. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the restore settings, the restore appears. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under Backup Files, only the files in it are backed up as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">This deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device node for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must reference the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted, the command load load to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before read- or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try and block the ejection of the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is automatically ejected when loosening the mount. do not use this option on floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you need to share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; formatted a tape, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, on information about issues that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access, for example, on information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; hence attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, it provides functions to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting & ksystemlog, first try to open the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol. if this is not displayed, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most probably not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log directory, which normally does not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or set strings. add a string line to the filter bar. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so only log lines are displayed next to the filter. then a protocol line will only be displayed when one of the columns is the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. for example, in the Protocol File System Protocol, select the column process, and additionally, in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so you show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines. log lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as the protocol lines of the Level Note. the color representation of log lines can be turned off settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to add new lines in the main window context menu to display all new add-in lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following directory: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming a standard for the control of program starts when running the system in the & Linux; world. and that's because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is below / sbin and not on / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting it. the & Linux; kernel first looks at / etc after an init file. so you must make sure the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you would like to start when moving the system or when changing to another Runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial section:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a little messed up, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would pause the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server runlevel that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of Available Systems Services to one of the six runways to start it (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it anywhere else. the entry will be removed from its original runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them to a new area. to copy them to a new entry level, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the resulting entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover entries thrown into the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Available Systems Services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to change the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine is running steadily again. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to start, it is sufficient to read the chapter adapting & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the respective icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double-clicking on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space limitations (quota) for users, a card map will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management appears in case of shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one embedded filesystem space restriction (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limited number of limitations in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with space restriction</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups inform about the group dependencies of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog provides a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and modify the boot password, change the time to boot from the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
